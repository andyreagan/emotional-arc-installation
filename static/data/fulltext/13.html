         <em>This book is dedicated to Edward Beitchman, my beloved uncle, who
         gave me my first concept of heaven. Every year, around the
         Thanksgiving table, he spoke of a night in the hospital when he awoke
         to see the souls of his departed loved ones sitting on the edge of the
         bed, waiting for him. I never forgot that story. And I never forgot
         him.</em>

      <p>
         <em>Everyone has an idea of heaven, as do most religions, and they
         should all be respected. The version represented here is only a guess,
         a wish, in some ways, that my uncle, and others like him&mdash;people
         who felt unimportant here on earth&mdash;realize, finally, how much
         they mattered and how they were loved.</em>

         THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A MAN named Eddie and it begins at the end, with
         Eddie dying in the sun. It might seem strange to start a story with an
         ending. But all endings are also beginnings. We just don&#39;t know it
         at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THE LAST HOUR of Eddie&#39;s life was spent, like most of the others,
         at Ruby Pier, an amusement park by a great gray ocean. The park had
         the usual attractions, a boardwalk, a Ferris wheel, roller coasters,
         bumper cars, a taffy stand, and an arcade where you could shoot
         streams of water into a clown&#39;s mouth. It also had a big new ride
         called Freddy&#39;s Free Fall, and this would be where Eddie would be
         killed, in an accident that would make newspapers around the state.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         AT THE TIME of his death, Eddie was a squat, white-haired old man,
         with a short neck, a barrel chest, thick fore&shy;arms, and a faded
         army tattoo on his right shoulder. His legs were thin and veined now,
         and his left knee, wounded in the war, was ruined by arthritis. He
         used a cane to get around. His face was broad and craggy from the sun,
         with salty whiskers and a lower jaw that protruded slightly, making
         him look prouder than he felt. He kept a cigarette behind his left ear
         and a ring of keys hooked to his belt. He wore rubber-soled shoes. He
         wore an old linen cap. His pale brown uni&shy;form suggested a
         workingman, and a workingman he was.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         EDDIE&#39;S JOB WAS &quot;maintaining&quot; the rides, which really
         meant keeping them safe. Every afternoon, he walked the park, checking
         on each attraction, from the Tilt-A-Whirl to the Pipeline Plunge. He
         looked for broken boards, loose bolts, worn-out steel. Sometimes he
         would stop, his eyes glazing over, and people walking past thought
         something was wrong. But he was listening, that&#39;s all. After all
         these years he could <em>hear</em> trouble, he said, in the spits and
         stut&shy;ters and thrumming of the equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         WITH 50 MINUTES left on earth, Eddie took his last walk along Ruby
         Pier. He passed an elderly couple.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Folks,&quot; he mumbled, touching his cap.
      </p>
      <p>
         They nodded politely. Customers knew Eddie. At least the regular ones
         did. They saw him summer after summer, one of those faces you
         associate with a place. His work shirt had a patch on the chest that
         read EDDIE above the word MAINTENANCE, and sometimes they would say,
         &quot;Hiya, Eddie Maintenance,&quot; although he never thought that
         was funny.
      </p>
      <p>
         Today, it so happened, was Eddie&#39;s birthday, his 83rd. A doctor,
         last week, had told him he had shingles. Shin&shy;gles? Eddie
         didn&#39;t even know what they were. Once, he had been strong enough
         to lift a carousel horse in each arm. That was a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;EDDIE!&quot; . . . &quot;TAKE ME, Eddie!&quot; . . . &quot;Take
         me!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Forty minutes until his death. Eddie made his way to the front of the
         roller coaster line. He rode every attraction at least once a week, to
         be certain the brakes and steering were solid. Today was coaster
         day&mdash;the &quot;Ghoster Coaster&quot; they called this
         one&mdash;and the kids who knew Eddie yelled to get in the cart with
         him.
      </p>
      <p>
         Children liked Eddie. Not teenagers. Teenagers gave him headaches.
         Over the years, Eddie figured he&#39;d seen every sort of do-nothing,
         snarl-at-you teenager there was. But children were different. Children
         looked at Eddie&mdash;who, with his protruding lower jaw, always
         seemed to be grinning, like a dolphin&mdash;and they trusted him. They
         drew in like cold hands to a fire. They hugged his leg. They played
         with his keys. Eddie mostly grunted, never saying much. He figured it
         was because he didn&#39;t say much that they liked him.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THIRTY MINUTES LEFT.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Hey, happy birthday, I hear,&quot; Dominguez said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie grunted.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No party or nothing?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked at him as if he were crazy. For a moment he thought how
         strange it was to be growing old in a place that smelled of cotton
         candy.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Well, remember, Eddie, I&#39;m off next week, starting Monday.
         Going to Mexico.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie nodded, and Dominguez did a little dance.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Me and Theresa. Gonna see the whole family. Par-r-r-ty.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He stopped dancing when he noticed Eddie staring.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You ever been?&quot; Dominguez said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Been?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;To Mexico?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie exhaled through his nose. &quot;Kid, I never been anywhere I
         wasn&#39;t shipped to with a rifle.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He watched Dominguez return to the sink. He thought for a moment. Then
         he took a small wad of bills from his pocket and removed the only
         twenties he had, two of them. He held them out.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Get your wife something nice,&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Dominguez regarded the money, broke into a huge smile, and said,
         &quot;C&#39;mon, man. You sure?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie pushed the money into Dominguez&#39;s palm. Then he walked out
         back to the storage area. A small &quot;fishing hole&quot; had been
         cut into the boardwalk planks years ago, and Eddie lifted the plastic
         cap. He tugged on a nylon line that dropped 80 feet to the sea. A
         piece of bologna was still attached.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;We catch anything?&quot; Dominguez yelled. &quot;Tell me we
         caught something!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie wondered how the guy could be so optimistic. There was never
         anything on that line.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;One day,&quot; Dominguez yelled, &quot;we&#39;re gonna get a
         halibut!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yep,&quot; Eddie mumbled, although he knew you could never pull
         a fish that big through a hole that small.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         TWENTY-SIX MINUTES to live. Eddie crossed the board&shy;walk to the
         south end. Business was slow. The girl behind the taffy counter was
         leaning on her elbows, popping her gum.
      </p>
      <p>
         Once, Ruby Pier was <em>the</em> place to go in the summer. It had
         elephants and fireworks and marathon dance contests. But people
         didn&#39;t go to ocean piers much anymore; they went to theme parks
         where you paid $75 a ticket and had your photo taken with a giant
         furry character.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie limped past the bumper cars and fixed his eyes on a group of
         teenagers leaning over the railing. <em>Great</em>, he told himself.
         <em>Just what I need</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Off,&quot; Eddie said, tapping the railing with his cane.
         C&#39;mon. It s not safe.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Whrrrssssh</em>, A wave broke on the beach. Eddie coughed up
         something he did not want to see. He spat it away.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Whrrssssssh</em>. He used to think a lot about Marguerite. Not so
         much now. She was like a wound beneath an old bandage, and he had
         grown more used to the bandage.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Whrrssssssh.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         What was shingles?
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Whrrsssssh.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         Sixteen minutes to live.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         NO STORY SITS by itself. Sometimes stories meet at corners and
         sometimes they cover one another completely, like stones beneath a
         river.
      </p>
      <p>
         The end of Eddie&#39;s story was touched by another seemingly innocent
         story, months earlier&mdash;a cloudy night when a young man arrived at
         Ruby Pier with three of his friends.
      </p>
      <p>
         The young man, whose name was Nicky, had just be&shy;gun driving and
         was still not comfortable carrying a key chain. So he removed the
         single car key and put it in his jacket pocket, then tied the jacket
         around his waist.
      </p>
      <p>
         For the next few hours, he and his friends rode all the fastest rides:
         the Flying Falcon, the Splashdown, Freddy&#39;s Free Fall, the Ghoster
         Coaster.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Hands in the air!&quot; one of them yelled.
      </p>
      <p>
         They threw their hands in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
         Later, when it was dark, they returned to the car lot, exhausted and
         laughing, drinking beer from brown paper bags. Nicky reached into his
         jacket pocket. He fished around. He cursed.
      </p>
      <p>
         The key was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         FOURTEEN MINUTES UNTIL his death. Eddie wiped his brow with a
         handkerchief. Out on the ocean, diamonds of sunlight danced on the
         water, and Eddie stared at their nimble movement. He had not been
         right on his feet since the war.
      </p>
      <p>
         But back at the Stardust Band Shell with Marguerite&mdash;there Eddie
         had still been graceful. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to
         summon the song that brought them to&shy;gether, the one Judy Garland
         sang in that movie. It mixed in his head now with the cacophony of the
         crashing waves and children screaming on the rides.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You made me love you&mdash;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Whsssshhhh.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;&mdash;do it, I didn&#39;t want to do i&mdash;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Spllllldddaashhhhhhh.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;&mdash;me love you&mdash;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eeeeeeee!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;&mdash;time you knew it, and all the&mdash;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Chhhhewisshhhh.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;-knew it. . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie felt her hands on his shoulders. He squeezed his eyes tightly,
         to bring the memory closer.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         TWELVE MINUTES TO live.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot; &#39;Scuse me.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         A young girl, maybe eight years old, stood before him, blocking his
         sunlight. She had blonde curls and wore flip-flops and denim cutoff
         shorts and a lime green T-shirt with a cartoon duck on the front. Amy,
         he thought her name was. Amy or Annie. She&#39;d been here a lot this
         summer, al&shy;though Eddie never saw a mother or father.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot; &#39;Scuuuse me,&quot; she said again. &quot;Eddie
         Maint&#39;nance?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie sighed. &quot;Just Eddie,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Eddie?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Um hmm?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Can you make me . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She put her hands together as if praying.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;C&#39;mon, kiddo. I don&#39;t have all day.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Can you make me an animal? <em>Can you</em>?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked up, as if he had to think about it. Then he reached into
         his shirt pocket and pulled out three yellow pipe cleaners, which he
         carried for just this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yesssss!&quot; the little girl said, slapping her hands.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie began twisting the pipe cleaners.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Where&#39;s your parents?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &#39;&quot;Riding the rides.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Without you?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The girl shrugged. &quot;My mom&#39;s with her boyfriend.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked up. Oh.
      </p>
      <p>
         He bent the pipe cleaners into several small loops, then twisted the
         loops around one another. His hands shook now, so it took longer than
         it used to, but soon the pipe cleaners resembled a head, ears, body,
         and tail.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;A rabbit?&quot; the little girl said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie winked.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Thaaaank you!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She spun away, lost in that place where kids don&#39;t even know their
         feet are moving. Eddie wiped his brow again, then closed his eyes,
         slumped into the beach chair, and tried to get the old song back into
         his head.
      </p>
      <p>
         A seagull squawked as it flew overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         HOW DO PEOPLE choose their final words? Do they re&shy;alize their
         gravity? Are they fated to be wise?
      </p>
      <p>
         By his 83rd birthday, Eddie had lost nearly everyone he&#39;d cared
         about. Some had died young, and some had been given a chance to grow
         old before a disease or an accident took them away. At their funerals,
         Eddie listened as mourn&shy;ers recalled their final conversations.
         &quot;<em>It&#39;s as if he knew he was going to die</em>. . . .&quot;
         some would say.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie never believed that. As far as he could tell, when your time
         came, it came, and that was that. You might say something smart on
         your way out, but you might just as easily say something stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
         For the record, Eddie&#39;s final words would be &quot;Get back!&#39;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         HERE ARE THE sounds of Eddie&#39;s last minutes on earth. Waves
         crashing. The distant thump of rock music. The whirring engine of a
         small biplane, dragging an ad from its tail. And this.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;OH MY GOD! LOOK!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie felt his eyes dart beneath his lids. Over the years, he had come
         to know every noise at Ruby Pier and could sleep through them all like
         a lullaby.
      </p>
      <p>
         This voice was not in the lullaby.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;OH MY GOD! LOOK!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie bolted upright. A woman with fat, dimpled arms was holding a
         shopping bag and pointing and screaming. A small crowd gathered around
         her, their eyes to the skies.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie saw it immediately. Atop Freddy&#39;s Free Fall, the new
         &quot;tower drop&quot; attraction, one of the carts was tilted at an
         angle, as if trying to dump its cargo. Four passengers, two men, two
         women, held only by a safety bar, were grabbing frantically at
         anything they could.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; the fat woman yelled. &quot;THOSE PEOPLE!
         THEY&#39;RE GONNA FALL!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         A voice squawked from the radio on Eddie&#39;s belt. &quot;<em>Eddie!
         Eddie</em>!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He pressed the button. &quot;I see it! Get security!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         People ran up from the beach, pointing as if they had practiced this
         drill. <em>Look! Up in the sky! An amusement ride turned evil</em>!
         Eddie grabbed his cane and clomped to safety fence around the platform
         base, his wad of keys jan&shy;gling against his hip. His heart was
         racing.
      </p>
      <p>
         Freddy&#39;s Free Fall was supposed to drop two carts in a
         stomach-churning descent, only to be halted at the last in&shy;stant
         by a gush of hydraulic air. How did one cart come loose like that? It
         was tilted just a few feet below the upper plat&shy;form, as if it had
         started downward then changed its mind.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie reached the gate and had to catch his breath. Dominguez came
         running and nearly banged into him.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Listen to me!&quot; Eddie said, grabbing Dominguez by the
         shoulders. His grip was so tight, Dominguez made a pained face.
         &quot;Listen to me! Who&#39;s up there?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Willie.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;OK. He must&#39;ve hit the emergency stop. That&#39;s why the
         cart is hanging. Get up the ladder and tell Willie to manually release
         the safety restraint so those people can get out. OK? It&#39;s on the
         back of the cart, so you&#39;re gonna have to hold him while he leans
         out there. OK? Then . . . then, the two of ya&#39;s&mdash;the two of
         ya&#39;s now, not one, you got it?&mdash;the two of ya&#39;s get them
         out! One holds the other! Got it!? . . . <em>Got it</em>?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Dominguez nodded quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Then send that damn cart down so we can figure out what
         happened!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie&#39;s head was pounding. Although his park had been free of any
         major accidents, he knew the horror stories of his business. Once, in
         Brighton, a bolt unfastened on a gondola ride and two people fell to
         their death. Another time, in Wonderland Park, a man had tried to walk
         across a roller coaster track; he fell through and got stuck beneath
         his armpits. He was wedged in, screaming, and the cars came racing
         toward him and . . . well, that was the worst.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie pushed that from his mind. There were people all around him now,
         hands over their mouths, watching Dominguez climb the ladder. Eddie
         tried to remember the insides of Freddy&#39;s Free Fall. <em>Engine.
         Cylinders. Hydraulics. Seals. Cables</em>. How does a cart come loose?
         He followed the ride visually, from the four frightened people at the
         top, down the towering shaft, and into the base. <em>Engine.
         Cylin&shy;ders. Hydraulics. Seals. Cables.. .</em> .
      </p>
      <p>
         Dominguez reached the upper platform. He did as Eddie told him,
         holding Willie as Willie leaned toward the back of the cart to release
         the restraint. One of the female riders lunged for Willie and nearly
         pulled him off the platform. The crowd gasped.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Wait. . .&quot; Eddie said to himself.
      </p>
      <p>
         Willie tried again. This time he popped the safety release.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Cable .. .&quot; Eddie mumbled.
      </p>
      <p>
         The bar lifted and the crowd went &quot;Ahhhhh.&quot; The rid&shy;ers
         were quickly pulled to the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The cable is <em>unraveling.</em> . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         And Eddie was right. Inside the base of Freddy&#39;s Free Fall, hidden
         from view, the cable that lifted Cart No. 2 had, for the last few
         months, been scraping across a locked pulley. Because it was locked,
         the pulley had gradually ripped the cable&#39;s steel wires&mdash;as
         if husking an ear of corn&mdash;until they were nearly severed. No one
         noticed. How could they notice? Only someone who had crawled inside
         the mecha&shy;nism would have seen the unlikely cause of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
         The pulley was wedged by a small object that must have fallen through
         the opening at a most precise moment.
      </p>
      <p>
         A car key.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;DON&#39;T RELEASE THE CART!&quot; Eddie yelled. He waved his
         arms. &quot;HEY! HEEEEY! IT&#39;S THE CABLE! DON&#39;T RELEASE THE
         CART! IT&#39;LL SNAP!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The crowd drowned him out. It cheered wildly as Willie and Dominguez
         unloaded the final rider. All four were safe. They hugged atop the
         platform.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;DOM! WILLIE!&quot; Eddie yelled. Someone banged against his
         waist, knocking his walkie-talkie to the ground. Eddie bent to get it.
         Willie went to the controls. He put his finger on the green button.
         Eddie looked up.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;NO, NO, NO, DON&#39;T!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie turned to the crowd. &quot;GET BACK!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Something in Eddie&#39;s voice must have caught the peo&shy;ple&#39;s
         attention; they stopped cheering and began to scatter. An opening
         cleared around the bottom of Freddy&#39;s Free Fall.
      </p>
      <p>
         And Eddie saw the last face of his life.
      </p>
      <p>
         She was sprawled upon the ride&#39;s metal base, as if someone had
         knocked her into it, her nose running, tears filling her eyes, the
         little girl with the pipe-cleaner animal. Amy? Annie?
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Ma ... Mom ... Mom ...&quot; she heaved, almost
         rhyth&shy;mically, her body frozen in the paralysis of crying
         children.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Ma . . . Mom ... Ma ... Mom .. .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie&#39;s eyes shot from her to the carts. Did he have time? Her to
         the carts&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Whump</em>. Too late. The carts were dropping. <em>Jesus, he
         released the brake!&mdash;</em>and for Eddie, everything slipped into
         watery motion. He dropped his cane and pushed off his bad leg and felt
         a shot of pain that almost knocked him down. A big step. Another step.
         Inside the shaft of Freddy&#39;s Free Fall, the cable snapped its
         final thread and ripped across the hydraulic line. Cart No. 2 was in a
         dead drop now, nothing to stop it, a boul&shy;der off a cliff.
      </p>
      <p>
         In those final moments, Eddie seemed to hear the whole world: distant
         screaming, waves, music, a rush of wind, a low, loud, ugly sound that
         he realized was his own voice blasting through his chest. The little
         girl raised her arms. Eddie lunged. His bad leg buckled. He half flew,
         half stumbled toward her, landing on the metal platform, which ripped
         through his shirt and split open his skin, just beneath the patch that
         read EDDIE and MAINTENANCE. He felt two hands in his own, two small
         hands.
      </p>
      <p>
         A stunning impact.
      </p>
      <p>
         A blinding flash of light.
      </p>
      <p>
         And then, nothing.

         <em>It is the 1920s, a crowded hospital in one of the poorest sections
         of the city. Eddie&#39;s father smokes cigarettes in the waiting room,
         where the other fathers are also smoking cigarettes. The nurse enters
         with a clipboard. She calls his name. She mispronounces it. The other

         <em>&quot;Wait here,&quot; she says.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Through the glass, he sees her check the numbers of the wooden

      <h3>
         The Journey
      </h3>
      <p>
         EDDIE SAW NOTHING OF HIS FINAL MOMENT on earth, nothing of the pier or
         the crowd or the shattered fiber&shy;glass cart.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the stories about life after death, the soul often floats above the
         good-bye moment, hovering over police cars at highway accidents, or
         clinging like a spider to hospital-room ceilings. These are people who
         receive a second chance, who somehow, for some reason, resume their
         place in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie, it appeared, was not getting a second chance.
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>WHERE . . . ?</i> <em>Where...? Where</em>...? The sky was a misty
         pumpkin shade, then a deep turquoise, then a bright lime. Eddie was
         floating, and his arms were still extended.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Where... ?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         The tower cart was falling. He remembered that. The little
         girl&mdash;Amy? Annie?&mdash;she was crying. He remembered that. He
         remembered lunging. He remembered hitting the platform. He felt her
         two small hands in his.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Then what?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Did I save her?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie could only picture it at a distance, as if it hap&shy;pened
         years ago. Stranger still, he could not <em>feel</em> any
         emo&shy;tions that went with it. He could only feel calm, like a child
         in the cradle of its mother&#39;s arms.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Where...?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         The sky around him changed again, to grapefruit yel&shy;low, then a
         forest green, then a pink that Eddie momentar&shy;ily associated with,
         of all things, cotton candy.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Did I save her?</em>

         That was what was missing. Every hurt he&#39;d ever suf&shy;fered,
         every ache he&#39;d ever endured&mdash;it was all as gone as an
         expired breath. He could not feel agony. He could not feel sadness.
         His consciousness felt smoky, wisplike, incapable of anything but
         calm. Below him now, the colors changed again. Something was swirling.
         Water. An ocean. He was floating over a vast yellow sea. Now it turned
         melon. Now it was sapphire. Now he began to drop, hurtling toward the
         surface. It was faster than anything he&#39;d ever imagined, yet there
         wasn&#39;t as much as a breeze on his face, and he felt no fear. He
         saw the sands of a golden shore.
      </p>
      <p>
         Then he was under water.
      </p>
      <p>
         Then everything was silent.

         Today Is Eddie&#39;s Birthday
      </h3>
      <p>
         <em>He is five years old. It is a Sunday afternoon at Ruby Pier.
         Picnic tables are set along the boardwalk, which overlooks the long
         white beach. There is a vanilla cake with blue wax candles. There is a
         bowl of orange juice. The pier workers are milling about, the barkers,
         the sideshow acts, the animal trainers, some men from the fishery.
         Eddie&#39;s father, as usual, is in a card game. Eddie plays at his
         feet. His older brother, Joe, is doing push-ups in front of a group of
         elderly women, who feign interest and clap politely.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie is wearing his birthday gift, a red cowboy hat and a toy
         holster. He gets up and runs from one group to the next, pulling out
         the toy gun and going, &quot;Bang, bang!&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;C&#39;mere boy,&quot; Mickey Shea beckons from a bench.</em>

      <p>
         <em>&quot;Bang, bang,&quot; goesEddie.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Mickey Shea works with Eddie&#39;s dad, fixing the rides. He is
         fat and wears suspenders and is always singing Irish songs. To Eddie,

      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>C&#39;mere. Lemme do your birthday bumps,&quot; he says.
         &quot;Like we do in Ireland</em>.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Suddenly, Mickey&#39;s large hands are under Eddie&#39;s he is
         hoisted up, then flipped over and dangled by the feet. Eddie&#39;s hat
         falls off.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Careful, Mickey!&quot; Eddie&#39;s mother yells. Eddie s

      <p>
         &quot;<em>Ho, ho. I got &#39;im,&quot; Mickey says. &quot;Now. One

      <p>
         <em>Mickey lifts Eddie back up. The others join in, laughing. They

         <em>Eddie is flipped right-side up and put down. Everybody claps.
         Eddie reaches for his hat, then stumbles over. He gets up, wobbles to
         Mickey Shea, and punches him in the arm.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Ho-ho! What was that for, little man?&quot; Mickey says.

         <em>&quot;Are you all right, my darling birthday boy?&quot; She is

         pull in their evening nets, the fish flipping like shiny, wet coins.
         She will hold his hand and tell him God is proud of him for being a
         good boy on his birthday, and that will make the world feel right-side

         The Arrival
      </h3>
      <p>
         EDDIE AWOKE IN A TEACUP.
      </p>
      <p>
         It was a part of some old amusement park ride&mdash;a large teacup,
         made of dark, polished wood, with a cushioned seat and a steel-hinged
         door. Eddie&#39;s arms and legs dangled over the edges. The sky
         continued to change colors, from a shoe-leather brown to a deep
         scarlet.
      </p>
      <p>
         His instinct was to reach for his cane. He had kept it by his bed the
         last few years, because there were mornings when he no longer had the
         strength to get up without it. This embarrassed Eddie, who used to
         punch men in the shoulders when he greeted them.
      </p>
      <p>
         But now there was no cane, so Eddie exhaled and tried to pull himself
         up. Surprisingly, his back did not hurt. His leg did not throb. He
         yanked harder and hoisted himself easily over the edge of the teacup,
         landing awkwardly on the ground, where he was struck by three quick
         thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
         First, he felt wonderful.
      </p>
      <p>
         Second, he was all alone.
      </p>
      <p>
         Third, he was still on Ruby Pier.
      </p>
      <p>
         But it was a different Ruby Pier now. There were can&shy;vas tents and
         vacant grassy sections and so few obstructions you could see the mossy
         breakwater out in the ocean. The colors of the attractions were
         firehouse reds and creamy whites&mdash;no teals or maroons&mdash;and
         each ride had its own wooden ticket booth. The teacup he had awoken in
         was part of a primitive attraction called Spin-O-Rama. Its sign was
         plywood, as were the other low-slung signs, hinged on storefronts that
         lined the promenade:
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>El Tiempo Cigars! Now, That&#39;s a Smoke!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Chowder, 10 cents!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Ride the Whipper&mdash;The Sensation of the Age!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie blinked hard. This was the Ruby Pier of his child&shy;hood, some
         <em>75</em> years ago, only everything was new, freshly scrubbed. Over
         there was the Loop-the-Loop ride&mdash;which had been torn down
         decades ago&mdash;and over there the bath&shy;houses and the saltwater
         swimming pools that had been razed in the 1950s. Over there, jutting
         into the sky, was the original Ferris wheel&mdash;in its pristine
         white paint&mdash;and be&shy;yond that, the streets of his old
         neighborhood and the rooftops of the crowded brick tenements,with
         laundry lines hanging from the windows. Eddie tried to yell, but his
         voice was raspy air. He mouthed a &quot;Hey!&quot; but nothing came
         from his throat.
      </p>
      <p>
         He grabbed at his arms and legs. Aside from his lack of voice, he felt
         incredible. He walked in a circle. He jumped. No pain. In the last ten
         years, he had forgotten what it was like to walk without wincing or to
         sit without struggling to find comfort for his lower back. On the
         outside, he looked the same as he had that morning: a squat
         barrel-chested old man in a cap and shorts and a brown maintenance
         jersey. But he was limber. So limber, in fact, he could touch behind
         his ankles, and raise a leg to his belly. He explored his body like an
         infant, fascinated by the new mechanics, a rubber man doing a rubber
         man stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
         Then he ran.
      </p>
      <p>
         Ha-ha! Running! Eddie had not truly run in more than 60 years, not
         since the war, but he was running now, starting with a few gingerly
         steps, then accelerating into a full gait, faster, faster, like the
         running boy of his youth. He ran along the boardwalk, past a
         bait-and-tackle stand for fisherman (five cents) and a bathing suit
         rental stand for swimmers (three cents). He ran past a chute ride
         called The Dipsy Doodle. He ran along the Ruby Pier Promenade, beneath
         magnificent buildings of moorish design with spires and minarets and
         onion-shaped domes. He ran past the Parisian Carousel, with its carved
         wooden horses, glass mirrors, and Wurlitzer organ, all shiny and new.
         Only an hour ago, it seemed, he had been scraping rust from its pieces
         in ths shop.
      </p>
      <p>
         He ran down the heart of the old midway, where the weight guessers,
         fortune-tellers, and dancing gypsies had once worked. He lowered his
         chin and held his arms out like a glider, and every few steps he would
         jump, the way children do, hoping running will turn to flying. It
         might have seemed ridiculous to anyone watching, this white-haired
         maintenaance worker, all alone, making like an airplane. But the
         running boy is inside every man, no matter how old he gets.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         AND THEN EDDIE stopped running. He heard something. A voice, tinny, as
         if coming through a megaphone.
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>How about him, ladies and gentlemen? Have you ever seen such a
         horrible sight? . . . &quot;</i>
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         Eddie was standing by an empty ticket kiosk in front of a large
         theater. The sign above read
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>The World&#39;s most Curious Citizens.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>Ruby pier&#39;s Sideshow!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>Holy Smoke! They&#39;re Fat! They&#39;re Skinny!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>See the Wild Man!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         The sideshow. The freak house. The ballyhoo hall. Eddie recalled them
         shutting this down at least 50 years ago, about the time television
         became popular and people didn&#39;t need sideshows to tickle their
         imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>&quot;Look well upon this savage, born into a most peculiar
         handicap ...&quot;</i>
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         Eddie peered into the entrance. He had encountered some odd people
         here. There was Jolly Jane, who weighed over 500 pounds and needed two
         men to push her up the stairs. There were conjoined twin sisters, who
         shared a spine and played musical instruments. There were men who
         swallowed swords, women with beards, and a pair of Indian brothers
         whose skin went rubbery from being stretched and soaked in oils, until
         it hung in bunches from their limbs.
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         Eddie, as a child, had felt sorry for the sideshow cast. They were
         forced to sit in booths or on stages, sometimes behind bars, as
         patrons walked past them, leering and pointing. A barker would
         ballyhoo the oddity, and it was a barker&#39;s voice that Eddie heard
         now.
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>&quot;Only a terrible twist of fate could leave a man in such a
         pitiful condition! From the farthest corner of the world, we have
         brought him for your examination___&quot;</i>
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         Eddie entered the darkened hall. The voice grew louder.
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>&quot;This tragic soul has endured a perversion of
         nature___&quot;</i>
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         It was coming from the other side of a stage.
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>&quot;Only here, at the World&#39;s Most Curious Citizens, can you
         draw this near....&quot;</i>
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         Eddie pulled aside the curtain.
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>&quot;Feast your eyes upon the most unus&mdash; &quot;</i>
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         The barker&#39;s voice vanished. And Eddie stepped back in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         There, sitting in a chair, alone on the stage, was a middle-aged man
         with narrow, stooped shoulders, naked from the waist up. His belly
         sagged over his belt. His hair was closely cropped. His lips were thin
         and his face was long and drawn. Eddie would have long since forgotten
         him, were it not for one distinctive feature.
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: normal">
         His skin was blue.
      </p>
      <p>
         <span style="font-style: normal">&quot;Hello, Edward,&quot; he said.
         &quot;I have been waiting for you.&quot;</span>

         <em><span style="font-style: normal">DON&#39;T</span></em> BE
         AFRAID....&quot; THE BLUE MAN said, rising slowly from his chair.
         &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid. . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         His voice was soothing, but Eddie could only stare. He had barely
         known this man. Why was he seeing him now? He was like one of those
         faces that pops into your dreams and the next morning you say,
         &quot;You&#39;ll never guess who I dreamed about last night.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Your body feels like a child&#39;s, right?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie nodded.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You were a child when you knew me, that&#39;s why. &quot;You
         start with the same feelings you had.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Start what</em>? Eddie thought.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man lifted his chin. His skin was a grotesque shade, a
         graying blueberry. His fingers were wrinkled. He walked outside. Eddie
         followed. The pier was empty. The beach was empty. Was the entire
         planet empty?
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Tell me something,&quot; the Blue Man said. He pointed to a
         two-humped wooden roller coaster in the distance. The Whipper. It was
         built in the 1920s, before under-friction wheels, meaning the cars
         couldn&#39;t turn very quickly&mdash;unless you wanted them launching
         off the track. &quot;The Whipper. Is it still the &#39;fastest ride on
         earth&#39;?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked at the old clanking thing, which had been torn down years
         ago. He shook his head no.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Ah,&quot; the Blue Man said. &quot;I imagined as much. Things
         don&#39;t change here. And there&#39;s none of that peering down from
         the clouds, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Here</em>? Eddie thought.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man smiled as if he&#39;d heard the question. He touched
         Eddie&#39;s shoulder and Eddie felt a surge of warmth unlike anything
         he had ever felt before. His thoughts came spilling out like
         sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>How did I die?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &#39;An accident,&quot; the Blue Man said.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>How long have I been dead?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &#39;A minute. An hour. A thousand years.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Where am I?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man pursed his lips, then repeated the ques&shy;tion
         thoughtfully. &quot;Where are you?&quot; He turned and raised his
         arms. All at once, the rides at the old Ruby Pier cranked to life: The
         Ferris wheel spun, the Dodgem Cars smacked into each other, the
         Whipper clacked uphill, and the Parisian Carousel horses bobbed on
         their brass poles to the cheery music of the Wurlitzer organ. The
         ocean was in front of them. The sky was the color of lemons.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Where do you think?&quot; the Blue Man asked.
         &quot;Heaven.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>NO</em>! EDDIE SHOOK his head violently. <em>NO</em>! The Blue Man
         seemed amused.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No? It can&#39;t be heaven?&quot; he said. &quot;Why? Because
         this is where you grew up?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie mouthed the word <em>Yes</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Ah.&quot; The Blue Man nodded. &quot;Well. People often belittle
         the place where they were born. But heaven can be found in the most
         unlikely corners. And heaven itself has many steps. This, for me, is
         the second. And for you, the first.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He led Eddie through the park, passing cigar shops and sausage stands
         and the &quot;flat joints,&quot; where suckers lost their nickels and
         dimes.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Heaven</em>? Eddie thought. Ridiculous. He had spent most of his
         adult life trying to get <em>away</em> from Ruby Pier. It was an
         amusement park, that&#39;s all, a place to scream and get wet and
         trade your dollars for kewpie dolls. The thought that this was some
         kind of blessed resting place was beyond his imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
         He tried again to speak, and this time he heard a small grunt from his
         chest. The Blue Man turned.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Your voice will come. We all go through the same thing. You
         cannot talk when you first arrive.&quot; He smiled. &quot;It helps you
         listen.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;THERE ARE FIVE people you meet in heaven,&quot; the Blue Man
         suddenly said. &quot;Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may
         not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for.
         For understanding your life on earth.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked confused.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;People think of heaven as a paradise garden, a place where they
         can float on clouds and laze in rivers and moun&shy;tains. But scenery
         without solace is meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;This is the greatest gift God can give you: to under&shy;stand
         what happened in your life. To have it explained. It is the peace you
         have been searching for.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie coughed, trying to bring up his voice. He was tired of being
         silent.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I am your first person, Edward. When I died, my life was
         illuminated by five others, and then I came here to wait for you, to
         stand in your line, to tell you my story, which be&shy;comes part of
         yours. There will be others for you, too. Some you knew, maybe some
         you didn&#39;t. But they all crossed your path before they died. And
         they altered it forever.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie pushed a sound up from his chest, as hard as he could.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What . . .&quot; he finally croaked.
      </p>
      <p>
         His voice seemed to be breaking through a shell, like a baby chick.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What. . . killed . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man waited patiently.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What... killed .. . you?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man looked a bit surprised. He smiled at Eddie.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yobu did,&quot; he said.

         &quot;LISTEN, MISTER,&quot; EDDIE rasped, &quot;I never killed you,
         OK? I don&#39;t even <em>know</em> you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man sat on a bench. He smiled as if trying to put a guest at
         ease. Eddie remained standing, a defensive posture.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Let me begin with my real name,&quot; the Blue Man said. &quot;I
         was christened Joseph Corvelzchik, the son of a tailor in a small
         Polish village. We came to America in 1894. I was only a boy. My
         mother held me over the railing of the ship and this became my
         earliest childhood memory, my mother swinging me in the breezes of a
         new world.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Like most immigrants, we had no money. We slept on a mattress in
         my uncle&#39;s kitchen. My father was forced to take a job in a
         sweatshop, sewing buttons on coats. When I was ten, he took me from
         school and I joined him.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie watched the Blue Man&#39;s pitted face, his thin lips, his
         sagging chest. <em>Why is he telling</em> me <em>this</em>? Eddie
         thought.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I was a nervous child by nature, and the noise in the shop only
         made things worse. I was too young to be there, amongst all those men,
         swearing and complaining.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Whenever the foreman came near, my father told me, &#39;Look
         down. Don&#39;t make him notice you.&#39; Once, however, I stumbled
         and dropped a sack of buttons, which spilled over the floor. The
         foreman screamed that I was worthless, a worthless child, that I must
         go. I can still see that moment, my father pleading with him like a
         street beggar, the fore&shy;man sneering, wiping his nose with the
         back of his hand. I felt my stomach twist in pain. Then I felt
         something wet on my leg. I looked down. The foreman pointed at my
         soiled pants and laughed, and the other workers laughed, too.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;After that, my father refused to speak to me. He felt I had
         shamed him, and I suppose, in his world, I had. But fathers can ruin
         their sons, and I was, in a fashion, ruined after that. I was a
         nervous child, and when I grew, I was a nervous young man. Worst of
         all, at night, I still wet the bed. In the mornings I would sneak the
         soiled sheets to the washbasin and soak them. One morning, I looked up
         to see my father. He saw the dirty sheets, then glared at me with eyes
         that I will never forget, as if he wished he could snap the cord of
         life between us.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man paused. His skin, which seemed to be soaked in blue
         fluid, folded in small fatty layers around his belt. Eddie
         couldn&#39;t help staring.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I was not always a freak, Edward,&quot; he said. &quot;But back
         then, medicine was rather primitive. I went to a chemist, seeking
         something for my nerves. He gave me a bottle of silver nitrate and
         told me to mix it with water and take it every night. Silver nitrate.
         It was later considered poison. But it was all I had, and when it
         failed to work, I could only assume I was not ingesting enough. So I
         took more. I swal&shy;lowed two gulps and sometimes three, with no
         water.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Soon, people were looking at me strangely. My skin was turning
         the color of ash.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I was ashamed and agitated. I swallowed even more silver
         nitrate, until my skin went from gray to blue, a side effect of the
         poison.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man paused. His voice dropped. &quot;The factory dismissed
         me. The foreman said I scared the other workers. Without work, how
         would I eat? Where would I live?
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I found a saloon, a dark place where I could hide beneath a hat
         and coat. One night, a group of carnival men were in the back. They
         smoked cigars. They laughed. One of them, a rather small fellow with a
         wooden leg, kept look&shy;ing at me. Finally, he approached.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;By the end of the night, I had agreed to join their carnival.
         And my life as a commodity had begun.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie noticed the resigned look on the Blue Man&#39;s face. He had
         often wondered where the sideshow cast came from. He assumed there was
         a sad story behind every one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The carnivals gave me my names, Edward. Sometimes I was the Blue
         Man of the North Pole, or the Blue Man of Algeria, or the Blue Man of
         New Zealand. I had never been to any of these places, of course, but
         it was pleasant to be considered exotic, if only on a painted sign.
         The &#39;show&#39; was simple. I would sit on the stage, half
         undressed, as peo&shy;ple walked past and the barker told them how
         pathetic I was. For this, I was able to put a few coins in my pocket.
         The manager once called me the &#39;best freak&#39; in his stable,
         and, sad as it sounds, I took pride in that. When you are an outcast,
         even a tossed stone can be cherished.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;One winter, I came to this pier. Ruby Pier. They were starting a
         sideshow called The Curious Citizens. I liked the idea of being in one
         place, escaping the bumpy horse carts of carnival life.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;This became my home. I lived in a room above a sausage shop. I
         played cards at night with the other sideshow workers, with the
         tinsmiths, sometimes even with your father. In the early mornings, if
         I wore long shirts and draped my head in a towel, I could walk along
         this beach without scaring people. It may not sound like much, but for
         me, it was a freedom I had rarely known.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He stopped. He looked at Eddie.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Do you understand? Why we&#39;re here? This is not <em>your</em>
         heaven. It&#39;s mine.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         TAKE ONE STORY, viewed from two different angles. Take a rainy Sunday
         morning in July, in the late 1920s, when Eddie and his friends are
         tossing a baseball Eddie got for his birthday nearly a year ago. Take
         a moment when that ball flies over Eddie&#39;s head and out into the
         street. Eddie, wearing tawny pants and a wool cap, chases after it,
         and runs in front of an automobile, a Ford Model A. The car screeches,
         veers, and just misses him. He shivers, ex&shy;hales, gets the ball,
         and races back to his friends. The game soon ends and the children run
         to the arcade to play the Erie Digger machine, with its claw-like
         mechanism that picks up small toys.
      </p>
      <p>
         Now take that same story from a different angle. A man is behind the
         wheel of a Ford Model A, which he has borrowed from a friend to
         practice his driving. The road is wet from the morning rain. Suddenly,
         a baseball bounces across the street, and a boy comes racing after it.
         The driver slams on the brakes and yanks the wheel. The car skids, the
         tires screech.
      </p>
      <p>
         The man somehow regains control, and the Model A rolls on. The child
         has disappeared in the rearview mirror, but the man&#39;s body is
         still affected, thinking of how close he came to tragedy. The jolt of
         adrenaline has forced his heart to pump furiously and this heart is
         not a strong one and the pumping leaves him drained. The man feels
         dizzy and his head drops momentarily. His automobile nearly collides
         with another. The second driver honks, the man veers again, spinning
         the wheel, pushing on the brake pedal. He skids along an avenue then
         turns down an alley. His vehicle rolls until it collides with the rear
         of a parked truck. There is a small crashing noise. The headlights
         shatter. The impact smacks the man into the steering wheel. His
         forehead bleeds. He steps from the Model A, sees the damage, then
         collapses onto the wet pavement. His arm throbs. His chest hurts. It
         is Sunday morning. The alley is empty. He remains there, unnoticed,
         slumped against the side of the car. The blood from his coronary
         arteries no longer flows to his heart. An hour passes. A policeman
         finds him. A medical exam&shy;iner pronounces him dead. The cause of
         death is listed as &quot;heart attack.&quot; There are no known
         relatives.
      </p>
      <p>
         Take one story, viewed from two different angles. It is the same day,
         the same moment, but one angle ends hap&shy;pily, at an arcade, with
         the little boy in tawny pants drop&shy;ping pennies into the Erie
         Digger machine, and the other ends badly, in a city morgue, where one
         worker calls another worker over to marvel at the blue skin of the
         newest arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You see?&quot; the Blue Man whispered, having finished the story
         from his point of view. &quot;Little boy?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie felt a shiver.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Oh no,&quot; he whispered.

         who normally wear gold lame and red turbans are now in black suits,
         like his father. The women seem to be wearing the same black, dress;
         some cover their faces in veils.</em>

         <em>Eddie watches a man shovel dirt into a hole. The man says
         something about ashes. Eddie holds his mothers hand and squints at the
         sun. He is supposed to be sad, he knows, but he is secretly counting
         numbers, starting from 1, hoping that by the time he reaches 1000 he
         will have his birthday back.</em>

      <h3>
         The First Lesson
      </h3>
      <p>
         PLEASE, MISTER . . .&quot; EDDIE PLEADED. &quot;I DIDN&#39;T know.
         Believe me . . . God help me, I didn&#39;t know.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man nodded. &quot;You couldn&#39;t know. You were too
         young.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie stepped back. He squared his body as if bracing for a fight.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;But now I gotta pay,&quot; he said. To pay?
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;For my sin. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here, right? Justice?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man smiled. &quot;No, Edward. You are here so I can teach you
         something. All the people you meet here have one thing to teach
         you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie was skeptical. His fists stayed clenched.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What?&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;That there are no random acts. That we are all connected. That
         you can no more separate one life from an&shy;other than you can
         separate a breeze from the wind.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie shook his head. &quot;We were throwing a <em>ball</em>. It was
         <em>my</em> stupidity, running out there like that. Why should
         <em>you</em> have to die on account of <em>me</em>? It ain&#39;t
         <em>fair</em>.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man held out his hand. &quot;Fairness,&quot; he said,
         &quot;does not govern life and death. If it did, no good person would
         ever die young.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He rolled his palm upward and suddenly they were standing in a
         cemetery behind a small group of mourners. A priest by the gravesite
         was reading from a Bible. Eddie could not see faces, only the backs of
         hats and dresses and suit coats.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;My funeral,&quot; the Blue Man said. &quot;Look at the
         mourn&shy;ers. Some did not even know me well, yet they came. Why? Did
         you ever wonder? Why people gather when others die? Why people feel
         they <em>should</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It is because the human spirit knows, deep down, that all lives
         intersect. That death doesn&#39;t just take someone, it misses someone
         else, and in the small distance between be&shy;ing taken and being
         missed, lives are changed.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You say you should have died instead of me. But dur&shy;ing my
         time on earth, people died instead of me, too. It happens every day.
         When lightning strikes a minute after you are gone, or an airplane
         crashes that you might have been on. When your colleague falls ill and
         you do not. We think such things are random. But there is a balance to
         it all. One withers, another grows. Birth and death are part of a
         whole.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It is why we are drawn to babies ...&quot; He turned to the
         mourners. &quot;And to funerals.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked again at the gravesite gathering. He wondered if he&#39;d
         had a funeral. He wondered if anyone came. He saw the priest reading
         from the Bible and the mourners lowering their heads. This was the day
         the Blue Man had been buried, all those years ago. Eddie had been
         there, a lit&shy;tle boy, fidgeting through the ceremony, with no idea
         of the role he&#39;d played in it.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I still don&#39;t understand,&quot; Eddie whispered. &quot;What
         good came from your death?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You lived,&quot; the Blue Man answered.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;But we barely knew each other. I might as well have been a
         stranger.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man put his arms on Eddie&#39;s shoulders. Ed&shy;die felt
         that warm, melting sensation.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Strangers,&quot; the Blue Man said, &quot;are just family you
         have yet to come to know.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         WITH THAT, THE Blue Man pulled Eddie close. Instantly, Eddie felt
         everything the Blue Man had felt in his life rush&shy;ing into him,
         swimming in his body, the loneliness, the shame, the nervousness, the
         heart attack. It slid into Eddie like a drawer being closed.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I am leaving,&quot; the Blue Man whispered in his ear.
         &quot;This step of heaven is over for me. But there are others for you
         to meet.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Wait,&quot; Eddie said, pulling back. &quot;Just tell me one
         thing. Did I save the little girl? At the pier. Did I save her?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Blue Man did not answer. Eddie slumped. &quot;Then my death was a
         waste, just like my life.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No life is a waste,&quot; the Blue Man said. &quot;The only time
         we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He stepped back toward the gravesite and smiled. And as he did, his
         skin turned the loveliest shade of caramel-smooth and unblemished. It
         was, Eddie thought, the most perfect skin he had ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Wait!&quot; Eddie yelled, but he was suddenly whisked into the
         air, away from the cemetery, soaring above the great gray ocean. Below
         him, he saw the rooftops of old Ruby Pier, the spires and turrets, the
         flags flapping in the breeze.
      </p>
      <p>
         Then it was gone.

         <strong>SUNDAY, 3 P.M.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         Back at the pier, the crowd stood silently around the wreck&shy;age of
         Freddy&#39;s Free Fall. Old women touched their throats. Mothers
         pulled their children away. Several burly men in tank tops slid to the
         front, as if this were something they should handle, but once they got
         there, they, too, only looked on, helpless. The sun baked down,
         sharpening the shadows, caus&shy;ing them to shield their eyes as if
         they were saluting.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>How bad is it</em>? people whispered. From the back of the crowd,
         Dominguez burst through, his face red, his mainte&shy;nance shirt
         drenched in sweat. He saw the carnage.
      </p>
      <p>
         &#39;Ahh no, no, Eddie,&quot; he moaned, grabbing his head. Security
         workers arrived. They pushed people back. But then, they, too, fell
         into impotent postures, hands on their hips, waiting for the
         ambulances. It was as if all of them&mdash; the mothers, the fathers,
         the kids with their giant gulp soda cups&mdash;were too stunned to
         look and too stunned to leave. Death was at their feet, as a carnival
         tune played over the park speakers.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>How bad is it</em>? Sirens sounded. Men in uniforms arrived.
         Yellow tape was stretched around the area. The arcade booths pulled
         down their grates. The rides were closed indefinitely. Word spread
         across the beach of the bad thing that had happened, and by sunset,
         Ruby Pier was empty.

         <em>From his bedroom, even with the door closed, Eddie can smell the

         onions, a strong woody odor that he loves.</em>

         has given his collection to his school-aged cousins from Roma&shy;nia,
         who came to America a few months earlier. Eddie&#39;s family met them
         at the docks and they moved into the bedroom that Eddie shared with
         his brother, Joe. The cousins cannot speak English, but they like
         comic books. Anyhow, it gives Eddie an excuse to keep them

         The Second Person Eddie Meets in Heaven
      </h3>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         EDDIE FELT HIS FEET TOUCH GROUND. THE sky was changing again, from
         cobalt blue to charcoal gray, and Eddie was surrounded now by fallen
         trees and blackened rubble. He grabbed his arms, shoulders, thighs,
         and calves. He felt stronger than before, but when he tried to touch
         his toes, he could no longer do so. The limberness was gone. No more
         childish rubbery sensation. Every muscle he had was as tight as piano
         wire.
      </p>
      <p>
         He looked around at the lifeless terrain. On a nearby hill lay a
         busted wagon and the rotting bones of an animal. Eddie felt a hot wind
         whip across his face. The sky exploded to a flaming yellow.
      </p>
      <p>
         And once again, Eddie ran.
      </p>
      <p>
         He ran differently now, in the hard measured steps of a soldier. He
         heard thunder&mdash;or something like thunder, explosions, or bomb
         blasts&mdash;and he instinctively fell to the ground, landed on his
         stomach, and pulled himself along by his forearms. The sky burst open
         and gushed rain, a thick, brownish downpour. Eddie lowered his head
         and crawled along in the mud, spitting away the dirty water that
         gathered around his lips.
      </p>
      <p>
         Finally he felt his head brush against something solid. He looked up
         to see a rifle dug into the ground, with a helmet sitting atop it and
         a set of dog tags hanging from the grip. Blinking through the rain, he
         fingered the dog tags, then scrambled backward wildly into a porous
         wall of stringy vines that hung from a massive banyan tree. He dove
         into their darkness. He pulled his knees into a crouch. He tried to
         catch his breath. Fear had found him, even in heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
         The name on the dog tags was his.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>

         YOUNG MEN GO to war. Sometimes because they have to, sometimes because
         they want to. Always, they feel they are supposed to. This comes from
         the sad, layered stories of life, which over the centuries have seen
         courage confused with picking up arms, and cowardice confused with
         laying them down.
      </p>
      <p>
         When his country entered the war, Eddie woke up early one rainy
         morning, shaved, combed back his hair, and enlisted. Others were
         fighting. He would, too.
      </p>
      <p>
         His mother did not want him to go. His father, when informed of the
         news, lit a cigarette and blew the smoke out slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;When?&quot; was all he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
         Since he&#39;d never fired an actual rifle, Eddie began to practice at
         the shooting arcade at Ruby Pier. You paid a nickel and the machine
         hummed and you squeezed the trig&shy;ger and fired metal slugs at
         pictures of jungle animals, a lion or a giraffe. Eddie went every
         evening, after running the brake levers at the Li&#39;l Folks
         Miniature Railway. Ruby Pier had added a number of new, smaller
         attractions, because roller coasters, after the Depression, had become
         too ex&shy;pensive. The Miniature Railway was pretty much just that,
         the train cars no higher than a grown man&#39;s thigh.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie, before enlisting, had been working to save money to study
         engineering. That was his goal&mdash;he wanted to build things, even
         if his brother, Joe, kept saying, &quot;C&#39;mon, Eddie, you
         aren&#39;t smart enough for that.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         But once the war started, pier business dropped. Most of Eddie&#39;s
         customers now were women alone with chil&shy;dren, their fathers gone
         to fight. Sometimes the children asked Eddie to lift them over his
         head, and when Eddie complied, he saw the mothers&#39; sad smiles: He
         guessed it was the right lift but the wrong pair of arms. Soon, Eddie
         figured, he would join those distant men, and his life of greasing
         tracks and running brake levers would be over. War was his call to
         manhood. Maybe someone would miss him, too.
      </p>
      <p>
         On one of those final nights, Eddie was bent over the small arcade
         rifle, firing with deep concentration. <em>Pang! Pang</em>! He tried
         to imagine actually shooting at the enemy. <em>Pang</em>! Would they
         make a noise when he shot them&mdash;<em>pang!&mdash;</em> or would
         they just go down, like the lions and giraffes?
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Pang! Pang!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Practicing to kill, are ya, lad?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Mickey Shea was standing behind Eddie. His hair was the color of
         French vanilla ice cream, wet with sweat, and his face was red from
         whatever he&#39;d been drinking. Eddie shrugged and returned to his
         shooting. <em>Pang</em>! Another hit. <em>Pang</em>! Another.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Hmmph,&quot; Mickey grunted.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie wished Mickey would go away and let him work on his aim. He
         could feel the old drunk behind him. He could hear his labored
         breathing, the nasal hissing in and out, like a bike tire being
         inflated by a pump.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie kept shooting. Suddenly, he felt a painful grip on his shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Listen to me, lad.&quot; Mickey&#39;s voice was a low growl.
         &quot;War is no game. If there&#39;s a shot to be made, you make it,
         you hear? No guilt. No hesitation, You fire and you fire and you
         don&#39;t think about who you&#39;re shootin&#39; or killin&#39; or
         why, y&#39;hear me? You want to come home again, you just fire, you
         don&#39;t think.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He squeezed even harder.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s the thinking that gets you killed.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie turned and stared at Mickey. Mickey slapped him hard on the
         cheek and Eddie instinctively raised his fist to retaliate. But Mickey
         belched and wobbled back&shy;ward. Then he looked at Eddie as if he
         were going to cry. The mechanical gun stopped humming. Eddie&#39;s
         nickel was up.
      </p>
      <p>
         Young men go to war, sometimes because they have to, sometimes because
         they want to. A few days later, Eddie packed a duffel bag and left the
         pier behind.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THE RAIN STOPPED. Eddie, shivering and wet beneath the banyan tree,
         exhaled a long, hard breath. He pulled the vines apart and saw the
         rifle and helmet still stuck in the ground. He remembered why soldiers
         did this: It marked the graves of their dead.
      </p>
      <p>
         He crawled out on his knees. Off in the distance, be&shy;low a small
         ridge, were the remains of a village, bombed and burnt into little
         more than rubble. For a moment, Ed&shy;die stared, his mouth slightly
         open, his eyes bringing the scene into tighter focus. Then his chest
         tightened like a man who&#39;d just had bad news broken. This place.
         He knew it. It had haunted his dreams. &quot;Smallpox,&quot; a voice
         suddenly said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie spun.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Smallpox. Typhoid. Tetanus. Yellow fever.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         It came from above, somewhere in the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I never did find out what yellow fever was. Hell. I never met
         anyone who had it.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The voice was strong, with a slight Southern drawl and gravelly edges,
         like a man who&#39;d been yelling for hours.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I got all those shots for all those diseases and I died here
         anyhow, healthy as a horse.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The tree shook. Some small fruit fell in front of Eddie.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;How you like <em>them</em> apples?&quot; the voice said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie stood up and cleared his throat.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Come out,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Come up,&quot; the voice said.
      </p>
      <p>
         And Eddie was in the tree, near the top, which was as tall as an
         office building. His legs straddled a large limb and the earth below
         seemed a long drop away. Through the smaller branches and thick fig
         leaves, Eddie could make out the shadowy figure of a man in army
         fatigues, sitting back against the tree trunk. His face was covered
         with a coal black substance. His eyes glowed red like tiny bulbs.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie swallowed hard.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Captain?&quot; he whispered. &quot;Is that you?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THEY HAD SERVED together in the army. The Captain was Eddie&#39;s
         commanding officer. They fought in the Philippines and they parted in
         the Philippines and Eddie had never seen him again. He had heard
         he&#39;d died in combat.
      </p>
      <p>
         A wisp of cigarette smoke appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;They explained the rules to you, soldier?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked down. He saw the earth far below, yet he knew he could
         not fall.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I&#39;m dead,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You got that much right.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;And <em>you</em> re dead.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Got that right, too.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;And you&#39;re . . . my second person?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain held up his cigarette. He smiled as if to say,
         &quot;<em>Can you believe you get to smoke up here</em>?&quot; Then he
         took a long drag and blew out a small white cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Betcha didn&#39;t expect me, huh?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         EDDIE LEARNED MANY things during the war. He learned to ride atop a
         tank. He learned to shave with cold water in his helmet. He learned to
         be careful when shooting from a foxhole, lest he hit a tree and wound
         himself with deflected shrapnel.
      </p>
      <p>
         He learned to smoke. He learned to march. He learned to cross a rope
         bridge while carrying, all at once, an overcoat, a radio, a carbine, a
         gas mask, a tripod for a machine gun, a backpack, and several
         bandoliers on his shoulder. He learned how to drink the worst coffee
         he&#39;d ever tasted.
      </p>
      <p>
         He learned a few words in a few foreign languages. He learned to spit
         a great distance. He learned the nervous cheer of a soldier&#39;s
         first survived combat, when the men slap each other and smile as if
         it&#39;s over&mdash; <em>We can go home now!&mdash;</em> and he
         learned the sinking depression of a soldier&#39;s second combat, when
         he realizes the fighting does not stop at one battle, there is more
         and more after that.
      </p>
      <p>
         He learned to whistle through his teeth. He learned to sleep on rocky
         earth. He learned that scabies are itchy little mites that burrow into
         your skin, especially if you&#39;ve worn the same filthy clothes for a
         week. He learned a man&#39;s bones really do look white when they
         burst through the skin.
      </p>
      <p>
         He learned to pray quickly. He learned in which pocket to keep the
         letters to his family and Marguerite, in case he should be found dead
         by his fellow soldiers. He learned that sometimes you are sitting next
         to a buddy in a dugout, whispering about how hungry you are, and the
         next instant there is a small <em>whoosh</em> and the buddy slumps
         over and his hunger is no longer an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
         He learned, as one year turned to two and two years turned toward
         three, that even strong, muscular men vomit on their shoes when the
         transport plane is about to unload them, and even officers talk in
         their sleep the night before combat.
      </p>
      <p>
         He learned how to take a prisoner, although he never learned how to
         become one. Then one night, on a Philippine island, his group came
         under heavy fire, and they scattered for shelter and the skies were
         lit and Eddie heard one of his buddies, down in a ditch, weeping like
         a child, and he yelled at him, &quot;Shut up, will ya!&quot; and he
         realized the man was crying because there was an enemy soldier
         stand&shy;ing over him with a rifle at his head, and Eddie felt
         some&shy;thing cold at his neck and there was one behind him, too.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THE CAPTAIN STUBBED out his cigarette. He was older than the men in
         Eddie&#39;s troop, a lifetime military man with a lanky swagger and a
         prominent chin that gave him a re&shy;semblance to a movie actor of
         the day. Most of the soldiers liked him well enough, although he had a
         short temper and a habit of yelling inches from your face, so you
         could see his teeth, already yellowed from tobacco. Still, the
         Cap&shy;tain always promised he would &quot;leave no one behind,&quot;
         no matter what happened, and the men took comfort in that.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Captain . . .&quot; Eddie said again, still stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
         &#39;Affirmative.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Sir.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No need for that. But much obliged.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s been ... You look . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Like the last time you saw me?&quot; He grinned, then spat over
         the tree branch. He saw Eddie&#39;s confused expres&shy;sion.
         &quot;You&#39;re right. Ain&#39;t no reason to spit up here. <em><span
         style="font-style: normal">You</span></em> don&#39;t get sick, either.
         Your breath is always the same. And the chow is incredible.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Chow</em>? Eddie didn&#39;t get any of this. &quot;Captain, look.
         There&#39;s some mistake. I still don&#39;t know why I&#39;m here. I
         had a nothing life, see? I worked maintenance. I lived in the same
         apartment for years. I took care of rides, Ferris wheels, roller
         coasters, stupid little rocket ships. It was nothing to be proud of. I
         just kind of drifted. What I&#39;m saying is . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie swallowed. &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain looked at him with those glowing red eyes and Eddie
         resisted asking the other question he now wondered after the Blue Man:
         Did he kill the Captain, too?
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You know, I&#39;ve been wondering,&quot; the Captain said
         rubbing his chin. &quot;The men from our unit&mdash;did they stay in
         touch? Willingham? Morton? Smitty? Did you ever see those guys?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie remembered the names. The truth was, they had not kept in touch.
         War could bond men like a magnet, but like a magnet it could repel
         them, too. The things they saw, the things they did. Sometimes they
         just wanted to forget.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;To be honest, sir, we all kind of fell out.&quot; He shrugged,
         &quot;Sorry.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain nodded as if he&#39;d expected as much.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;And you? You went back to that fun park where we all promised to
         go if we got out alive? Free rides for all GIs? Two girls per guy in
         the Tunnel of Love? Isn&#39;t that what you said?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie nearly smiled. That was what he&#39;d said. What they&#39;d all
         said. But when the war ended, nobody came.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yeah, I went back,&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;And?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;And ... I never left. I tried. I made plans. .. . But this damn
         leg. I don&#39;t know. Nothin&#39; worked out.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie shrugged. The Captain studied his face. His eyes narrowed. His
         voice lowered.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You still juggle?&quot; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         GO! ... YOU GO! ... YOU GO!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The enemy soldiers screamed and poked them with bayonets. Eddie,
         Smitty, Morton, Rabozzo, and the Captain were herded down a steep
         hill, hands on their heads. Mortar shells exploded around them. Eddie
         saw a figure run through the trees, then fall in a clap of bullets.
      </p>
      <p>
         He tried to take mental snapshots as they marched in the
         darkness&mdash;huts, roads, whatever he could make out&mdash;knowing
         such information would be precious for an escape. A plane roared in
         the distance, filling Eddie with a sudden, sickening wave of despair.
         It is the inner torture of every captured soldier, the short distance
         between freedom and seizure. If Eddie could only jump up and grab the
         wing of that plane, he could fly away from this mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
         Instead, he and the others were bound at the wrists and ankles. They
         were dumped inside a bamboo barracks. The barracks sat on stilts above
         the muddy ground, and they re&shy;mained there for days, weeks,
         months, forced to sleep on burlap sacks stuffed with straw. A clay jug
         served as their toilet. At night, the enemy guards would crawl under
         the hut and listen to their conversations. As time passed, they said
         less and less.
      </p>
      <p>
         They grew thin and weak. Their ribs grew visible&mdash;even Rabozzo,
         who had been a chunky kid when he enlisted. Their food consisted of
         rice balls filled with salt and, once a day, some brownish broth with
         grass floating in it. One night, Eddie plucked a dead hornet from the
         bowl. It was missing its wings. The others stopped eating.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THEIR CAPTORS SEEMED unsure of what to do with them. In the evenings,
         they would enter with bayonets and wiggle their blades at the
         Americans&#39; noses, yelling in a foreign language, waiting for
         answers. It was never productive.
      </p>
      <p>
         There were only four of them, near as Eddie could tell and the Captain
         guessed that they, too, had drifted away from a larger unit and were,
         as often happens in real war making it up day by day. Their faces were
         gaunt and bony with dark nubs of hair. One looked too young to be a
         soldier. Another had the most crooked teeth Eddie had ever seen. The
         Captain called them Crazy One, Crazy Two, Crazy Three, and Crazy Four.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;We don&#39;t want to know their names,&quot; he said. &quot;And
         we don&#39;t want them knowing ours.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Men adapt to captivity, some better than others. Mor&shy;ton, a
         skinny, chattering youth from Chicago, would fidget whenever he heard
         noises from outside, rubbing his chir and mumbling, &quot;Oh, damn, oh
         damn, oh damn . . .&quot; until the others told him to shut up.
         Smitty, a fireman&#39;s son from Brooklyn, was quiet most of the time,
         but he often seemed to be swallowing something, his Adam&#39;s apple
         loping up and down; Eddie later learned he was chewing on his tongue.
         Rabozzo, the young redheaded kid from Portland, Oregon, kept a poker
         face during the waking hours, but at night he often woke up screaming,
         &quot;Not me! Not me!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie mostly seethed. He clenched a fist and slapped it into his palm,
         hours on end, knuckles to skin, like the anx&shy;ious baseball player
         he had been in his youth. At night, he dreamed he was back at the
         pier, on the Derby Horse carousel, where five customers raced in
         circles until the bell rang. He was racing his buddies, or his
         brother, or Mar&shy;guerite. But then the dream turned, and the four
         Crazies were on the adjacent ponies, poking at him, sneering.
      </p>
      <p>
         Years of waiting at the pier&mdash;for a ride to finish, for the waves
         to pull back, for his father to speak to him&mdash;had trained Eddie
         in the art of patience. But he wanted out, and he wanted revenge. He
         ground his jaws and he slapped his palm and he thought about all the
         fights he&#39;d been in back in his old neighborhood, the time
         he&#39;d sent two kids to the hospital with a garbage can lid. He
         pictured what he&#39;d do to these guards if they didn&#39;t have
         guns.
      </p>
      <p>
         Then one morning, the prisoners were awakened by screaming and
         flashing bayonets and the four Crazies had them up and bound and led
         down into a shaft. There was no light. The ground was cold. There were
         picks and shovels and metal buckets.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s a goddamn coal mine,&quot; Morton said.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         FROM THAT DAY forward, Eddie and the others were forced to strip coal
         from the walls to help the enemy&#39;s war effort. Some shoveled, some
         scraped, some carried pieces of slate and built triangles to hold up
         the ceiling. There were other prisoners there, too, foreigners who
         didn&#39;t know English and who looked at Eddie with hollow eyes.
         Speak&shy;ing was prohibited. One cup of water was given every few
         hours. The prisoners&#39; faces, by the end of the day, were
         hopelessly black, and their necks and shoulders throbbed from leaning
         over.
      </p>
      <p>
         For the first few months of this captivity, Eddie went to sleep with
         Marguerite&#39;s picture in his helmet propped up in front of him. He
         wasn&#39;t much for praying, but he prayed just the same, making up
         the words and keeping count each night, saying, &quot;Lord, I&#39;ll
         give you these six days if you give me six days with her.... I&#39;ll
         give you these nine days if I get nine days with her.... I&#39;ll give
         you these sixteen days if I get sixteen days with her. ...&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Then, during the fourth month, something happened. Rabozzo developed
         an ugly skin rash and severe diarrhea. He couldn&#39;t eat a thing. At
         night, he sweated through his filthy clothes until they were soaking
         wet. He soiled himself. There were no clean clothes to give him so he
         slept naked on the burlap, and the Captain placed his sack over him
         like a blanket.
      </p>
      <p>
         The next day, down in the mine, Rabozzo could barely stand. The four
         Crazies showed no pity. When he slowed, they poked him with sticks to
         keep him scraping.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Leave him be,&quot; Eddie growled.
      </p>
      <p>
         Crazy Two, the most brutal of their captors, slammed Eddie with a
         bayonet butt. He went down, a shot of pain spreading between his
         shoulder blades. Rabozzo scraped a few more pieces of coal, then
         collapsed. Crazy Two screamed at him to get up.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;He&#39;s sick!&quot; Eddie yelled, struggling to his feet.
      </p>
      <p>
         Crazy Two slammed him down again.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Shut up, Eddie,&quot; Morton whispered. &quot;For your own
         good.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Crazy Two leaned over Rabozzo. He pulled back his eyelids. Rabozzo
         moaned. Crazy Two made an exaggerated smile and cooed, as if dealing
         with a baby. He went, &quot;Ahh,&quot; and laughed. He laughed looking
         at all of them, making eye con&shy;tact, making sure they were
         watching him. Then he pulled out his pistol, rammed it into
         Rabozzo&#39;s ear, and shot him in the head.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie felt his body rip in half. His eyes blurred and his brain went
         numb. The echo of the gunshot hung in the mine as Rabozzo&#39;s face
         soaked into a spreading puddle of blood. Morton put his hands over his
         mouth. The Captain looked down. Nobody moved.
      </p>
      <p>
         Crazy Two kicked black dirt over the body, then glared at Eddie and
         spat at his feet. He yelled something at Crazy Three and Crazy Four,
         both of whom seemed as stunned as the prisoners. For a moment, Crazy
         Three shook his head and mumbled, as if saying a prayer, his eyelids
         lowered and his lips moving furiously. But Crazy Two waved the gun and
         yelled again and Crazy Three and Crazy Four slowly lifted
         Rabozzo&#39;s body by its feet and dragged it along the mine floor,
         leaving a trail of wet blood, which, in the dark&shy;ness, looked like
         spilt oil. They dropped him against a wall, next to a pickax.
      </p>
      <p>
         After that, Eddie stopped praying. He stopped count&shy;ing days. He
         and the Captain spoke only of escaping before they all met the same
         fate. The Captain figured the enemy war effort was desperate, that was
         why they needed every half-dead prisoner to scrape coal. Each day in
         the mine there were fewer and fewer bodies. At night, Eddie heard
         bomb&shy;ing; it seemed to be getting closer. If things got too bad,
         the Captain figured, their captors would bail out, destroy
         every&shy;thing. He had seen ditches dug beyond the prisoner
         bar&shy;racks and large oil barrels positioned up the steep hill.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The oil&#39;s for burning the evidence,&quot; the Captain
         whis&shy;pered. &quot;They&#39;re digging our graves.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THREE WEEKS LATER, under a hazy-mooned sky, Crazy Three was inside the
         barracks, standing guard. He had two large rocks, almost the size of
         bricks, which, in his boredom, he tried to juggle. He kept dropping
         them, picking them up, tossing them high, and dropping them again.
         Eddie, covered in black ash, looked up, annoyed at the thudding noise.
         He&#39;d been trying to sleep. But now he lifted himself slowly. His
         vision cleared. He felt his nerves pricking to life.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Captain . . .&quot; he whispered. &quot;You ready to move?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain raised his head. &quot;What&#39;re you thinking?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Them rocks.&quot; Eddie nodded toward the guard.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What about &#39;em?&quot; the Captain said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I can juggle,&quot; Eddie whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain squinted. &quot;What?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         But Eddie was already yelling at the guard, &quot;Hey! Yo! You&#39;re
         doing it wrong!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He made a circular motion with his palms. &quot;This way! You do it
         this way! Gimme!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He held out his hands. &quot;I can juggle. Gimme.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Crazy Three looked at him cautiously. Of all the guards, Eddie felt,
         he had his best chance with this one. Crazy Three had occasionally
         sneaked the prisoners pieces of bread and tossed them through the
         small hut hole that served as a win&shy;dow. Eddie made the circular
         motion again and smiled. Crazy Three approached, stopped, went back
         for his bayo&shy;net, then walked the two rocks over to Eddie.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Like this,&quot; Eddie said, and he began to juggle
         effortlessly. He had learned when he was seven years old, from an
         Italian sideshow man who juggled six plates at once. Eddie had spent
         countless hours practicing on the boardwalk&mdash;pebbles, rubber
         balls, whatever he could find. It was no big deal. Most pier kids
         could juggle.
      </p>
      <p>
         But now he worked the two rocks furiously, juggling them faster,
         impressing the guard. Then he stopped, held the rocks out, and said,
         &quot;Get me another one.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Crazy Three grunted.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Three</em> rocks, see?&quot; Eddie held up three fingers.
         &quot;<em>Three</em>.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         By now, Morton and Smitty were sitting up. The Cap&shy;tain was moving
         closer.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Where are we going here?&quot; Smitty mumbled.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;If I can get one more rock . . .&quot; Eddie mumbled back.
      </p>
      <p>
         Crazy Three opened the bamboo door and did what Eddie&#39;d hoped he
         would do: He yelled for the others. Crazy One appeared with a fat rock
         and Crazy Two followed him in. Crazy Three thrust the rock at Eddie
         and yelled some&shy;thing. Then he stepped back, grinned at the
         others, and mo&shy;tioned for them to sit, as if to say, &quot;Watch
         this.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie tossed the rocks into a rhythmic weave. Each one was as big as
         his palm. He sang a carnival tune. &quot;<em>Da, da-da-da daaaaa</em>
         ...&quot; The guards laughed. Eddie laughed. The Captain laughed.
         Forced laughter, buying time.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Get <em>closer&quot;</em> Eddie sang, pretending the words were
         part of the melody. Morton and Smitty slid gently in, feign&shy;ing
         interest.
      </p>
      <p>
         The guards were enjoying the diversion. Their posture slackened. Eddie
         tried to swallow his breathing. Just a little longer. He threw one
         rock high into the air, then juggled the lower two, then caught the
         third, then did it again.
      </p>
      <p>
         &#39;Ahhh,&quot; Crazy Three said, despite himself.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You like that?&quot; Eddie said. He was juggling faster now. He
         kept tossing one rock high and watching his cap&shy;tors&#39; eyes as
         they followed it into the air. He sang, &quot;<em>Da, da-da-da
         daaa</em>,&quot; then, &quot;<em>When I count to three</em>,&quot;
         then, &quot;<em>Da, da-da-da daaaa</em>...&quot; then,
         &quot;<em>Captain, the guy on the lefffft</em>...&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Crazy Two frowned suspiciously, but Eddie smiled the way the jugglers
         back at Ruby Pier smiled when they were losing the audience.
         &quot;Lookie here, lookie here, lookie here!&quot; Eddie cooed.
         &quot;Greatest show on earth, buddy boy!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie went faster, then counted, &quot;One . . . two . . .&quot; then
         tossed a rock much higher than before. The Crazies watched it rise.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Now!&quot; Eddie yelled. In mid-juggle he grabbed a rock and,
         like the good baseball pitcher he had always been, whipped it hard
         into the face of Crazy Two, breaking his nose. Eddie caught the second
         rock and threw it, left-handed, square into the chin of Crazy One, who
         fell back as the Captain jumped him, grabbing his bayonet. Crazy
         Three, momentarily frozen, reached for his pistol and fired wildly as
         Morton and Smitty tackled his legs. The door burst open and Crazy Four
         ran in, and Eddie threw the last rock at him and missed his head by
         inches, but as he ducked, the Captain was waiting against the wall
         with the bayonet, which he drove through Crazy Four&#39;s rib cage so
         hard the two of them tumbled through the door. Eddie, powered by
         adrenaline, leaped on Crazy Two and pounded his face harder than he
         had ever pounded anyone back on Pitkin Avenue. He grabbed a loose rock
         and slammed it against his skull, again and again, until he looked at
         his hands and saw a hideous purplish goo that he realized was blood
         and skin and coal ash, mixed together&mdash;then he heard a gunshot
         and grabbed his head, smearing the goo on his temples. He looked up
         and saw Smitty standing over him, holding an enemy pistol. Crazy
         Two&#39;s body went slack. He was bleeding from the chest.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;For Rabozzo,&quot; Smitty mumbled.
      </p>
      <p>
         Within minutes, all four guards were dead.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THE PRISONERS, THIN and barefoot and covered in blood, were running
         now for the steep hill. Eddie had expected gun&shy;fire, more guards
         to fight, but there was no one. The other huts were empty. In fact,
         the entire camp was empty. Eddie wondered how long it had been just
         the four Crazies and them.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The rest probably took off when they heard the bombing,&quot;
         the Captain whispered. &quot;We&#39;re the last group left.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The oil barrels were pitched at the first rise of the hill. Less than
         100 yards away was the entrance to the coal mine. There was a supply
         hut nearby and Morton made sure it was empty, then ran inside; he
         emerged with an armful of grenades, rifles, and two primitive-looking
         flamethrowers. &quot;Let&#39;s burn it down,&quot; he said.

         <em>&quot;You don&#39;t have to ask me to wait, &quot;Marguerite says
         suddenly.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie swallows.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;I don&#39;t?&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>She shakes her head. Eddie smiles. Saved from a question that has
         caught in his throat all night, he feels as if a string has just shot
         from his heart and looped around her shoulders, pulling her close,
         making her his. He loves her more in this moment than he thought he
         could ever love anyone.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>A drop of rain hits Eddie&#39;s forehead. Then another. He looks
         up at the gathering clouds.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Hey, Hot Stuff?&quot; Marguerite says. She smiles but then
         her face droops and she blinks back water, although Eddie cannot tell
         if it is raindrops or tears.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Don&#39;t get killed, OK?&quot;she says.</em>

         A FREED SOLDIER is often furious. The days and nights he lost, the
         torture and humiliation he suffered&mdash;it all demands a fierce
         revenge, a balancing of the accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
         So when Morton, his arms full of stolen weapons, said to the others,
         &quot;Let&#39;s burn it down,&quot; there was quick if not logical
         agreement. Inflated by their new sense of control, the men scattered
         with the enemy&#39;s firepower, Smitty to the entrance of the mine
         shaft, Morton and Eddie to the oil barrels. The Captain went in search
         of a transport vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Five minutes, then back here!&quot; he barked. &quot;That
         bombing&#39;s gonna start soon and we need to be gone. Got it? Five
         minutes!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Which was all it took to destroy what had been their home for nearly
         half a year. Smitty dropped the grenades down the mine shaft and ran.
         Eddie and Morton rolled two barrels into the hut complex, pried them
         open, then, one by one, fired the nozzles of their newly acquired
         flamethrowers and watched the huts ignite.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Burn!&quot; Morton yelled.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Burn!&quot; Eddie yelled.
      </p>
      <p>
         The mine shaft exploded from below. Black smoke rose from the
         entrance. Smitty, his work done, ran toward the meeting point. Morton
         kicked his oil barrel into a hut and unleashed a rope-like burst of
         flame.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie watched, sneered, then moved down the path to the final hut. It
         was larger, more like a barn, and he lifted his weapon. <em>This was
         over</em>, he said to himself. <em>Over</em>. All these weeks and
         months in the hands of those bastards, those subhuman guards with
         their bad teeth and bony faces and the dead hornets in their soup. He
         didn&#39;t know what would happen to them next, but it could not be
         any worse than what they had endured.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie squeezed the trigger. <em>Whoosh</em>. The fire shot up quickly.
         The bamboo was dry, and within a minute the walls of the barn were
         melting in orange and yellow flames. Off in the distance, Eddie heard
         the rumble of an engine&mdash;the Captain, he hoped, had found
         something to escape in&mdash;and then, suddenly, from the skies, the
         first sounds of bombing, the noise they had been hearing every night.
         It was even closer now, and Eddie realized whoever it was would see
         the flames. They might be rescued. He might be going home! He turned
         to the burning barn and ...
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>What was that?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         He blinked.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>What was that?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         Something darted across the door opening. Eddie tried to focus. The
         heat was intense, and he shielded his eyes with his free hand. He
         couldn&#39;t be sure, but he thought he&#39;d just seen a small figure
         running inside the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Hey!&quot; Eddie yelled, stepping forward, lowering his weapon.
         &quot;HEY!&quot; The roof of the barn began to crumble, splashing
         sparks and flame. Eddie jumped back. His eyes watered. Maybe it was a
         shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;EDDIE! NOW!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Morton was up the path, waving for Eddie to come. Eddie&#39;s eyes
         were stinging. He was breathing hard. He pointed and yelled, &quot;I
         think there&#39;s someone in there!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Morton put a hand to his ear. &quot;What?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Someone ... in ... there!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Morton shook his head. He couldn&#39;t hear. Eddie turned and was
         almost certain he saw it again, there, crawl&shy;ing inside the
         burning barn, a child-size figure. It had been more than two years
         since Eddie had seen anything besides grown men, and the shadowy shape
         made him think sud&shy;denly of his small cousins back at the pier and
         the Li&#39;l Folks Miniature Railway he used to run and the roller
         coasters and the kids on the beach and Marguerite and her picture and
         all that he&#39;d shut from his mind for so many months.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;HEY! COME OUT!&quot; he yelled, dropping the flamethrower,
         moving even closer. &quot;I WON&#39;T SHOO-&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         A hand grabbed his shoulder, yanking him backward. Eddie spun, his
         fist clenched. It was Morton, yelling, &quot;EDDIE! We gotta go
         NOW!&quot; Eddie shook his head.
         &quot;No&mdash;no&mdash;wait&mdash;wait&mdash;wait, I think
         there&#39;s someone in th&mdash;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;There&#39;s nobody in there! NOW!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie was desperate. He turned back to the barn. Mor&shy;ton grabbed
         him again. This time Eddie spun around and swung wildly, hitting him
         in the chest. Morton fell to his knees. Eddie&#39;s head was pounding.
         His face twisted in anger. He turned again to the flames, his eyes
         nearly shut. <em>There. Was that it? Rolling behind a wall?
         There</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
         He stepped forward, convinced something innocent was being burned to
         death in front of him. Then the rest of the roof collapsed with a
         roar, casting sparks like electric dust that rained down on his head.
      </p>
      <p>
         In that instant, the whole of the war came surging out of him like
         bile. He was sickened by the captivity and sickened by the murders,
         sickened by the blood and goo dry&shy;ing on his temples, sickened by
         the bombing and the burning and the futility of it all. At that moment
         he just wanted to salvage something, a piece of Rabozzo, a piece of
         himself, something, and he staggered into the flaming wreckage, madly
         convinced that there was a soul inside every black shadow. Planes
         roared overhead and shots from their guns rang out in drumbeats.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie moved as if in a trance. He stepped past a burn&shy;ing puddle
         of oil, and his clothes caught fire from behind. A yellow flame moved
         up his calf and thigh. He raised his arms and hollered.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I&#39;LL HELP YOU! COME OUT! I WON&#39;T SHOO-&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         A piercing pain ripped through Eddie&#39;s leg. He screamed a long,
         hard curse then crumbled to the ground. Blood was spewing below his
         knee. Plane engines roared. The skies lit in bluish flashes.
      </p>
      <p>
         He lay there, bleeding and burning, his eyes shut against the searing
         heat, and for the first time in his life, he felt ready to die. Then
         someone yanked him backward, rolling him in the dirt, extinguishing
         the flames, and he was too stunned and weak to resist, he rolled like
         a sack of beans. Soon he was inside a transport vehicle and the others
         were around him, telling him to hang on, hang on. His back was burned
         and his knee had gone numb and he was getting dizzy and tired, so very
         tired.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THE CAPTAIN NODDED slowly, as he recalled those last moments.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You remember anything about how you got out of there?&quot; he
         asked.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Not really,&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It took two days. You were in and out of conscious&shy;ness. You
         lost a lot of blood.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;We made it though,&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yeaaah.&quot; The Captain drew the word out and punctu&shy;ated
         it with a sigh. &quot;That bullet got you pretty good.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         In truth, the bullet had never been fully removed. It had cut through
         several nerves and tendons and shattered against a bone, fracturing it
         vertically. Eddie had two surgeries. Nei&shy;ther cured the problem.
         The doctors said he&#39;d be left with a limp, one likely to get worse
         with age as the misshapen bones deteriorated. &quot;The best we can
         do,&quot; he was told. Was it? Who could say? All Eddie knew was that
         he&#39;d awoken in a medical unit and his life was never the same. His
         running was over. His dancing was over. Worse, for some reason, the
         way he used to feel about things was over, too. He withdrew. Things
         seemed silly or pointless. War had crawled inside of Eddie, in his leg
         and in his soul. He learned many things as a soldier. He came home a
         different man.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         DID YOU KNOW,&quot; the Captain said, &quot;that I come from three
         generations of military?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie shrugged.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Yep</em>. I knew how to fire a pistol when I was six. In the
         mornings, my father would inspect my bed, actually bounce a quarter on
         the sheets. At the dinner table it was always, &#39;Yes, sir,&#39;
         and, &#39;No, sir.&#39;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Before I entered the service, all I did was take orders. Next
         thing I knew, I was giving them.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Peacetime was one thing. Got a lot of wise-guy re&shy;cruits.
         But then the war started and the new men flooded in&mdash;young men,
         like you&mdash;and they were all saluting me, wanting me to tell them
         what to do. I could see the fear in their eyes. They acted as if I
         knew something about war that was classified. They thought I could
         keep them alive, You did, too, didn&#39;t you?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie had to admit he did.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain reached back and rubbed his neck. &quot;I couldn&#39;t, of
         course. I took my orders, too. But if I couldn&#39;t keep you alive, I
         thought I could at least keep you together. In the middle of a big
         war, you go looking for a small idea to believe in. When you find one,
         you hold it the way a sol&shy;dier holds his crucifix when he&#39;s
         praying in a foxhole.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;For me, that little idea was what I told you guys every day. No
         one gets left behind.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie nodded. &quot;That meant a lot,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain looked straight at him. &quot;I hope so,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         He reached inside his breast pocket, took out another cigarette, and
         lit up.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Why do you say that?&quot; Eddie asked.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain blew smoke, then motioned with the end of the cigarette
         toward Eddie&#39;s leg.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Because I was the one,&quot; he said, &quot;who shot you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         EDDIE LOOKED AT his leg, dangling over the tree branch. The surgery
         scars were back. So was the pain. He felt a welling of something
         inside him that he had not felt since before he died, in truth, that
         he had not felt in many years: a fierce, surging flood of anger, and a
         desire to hurt something. His eyes narrowed and he stared at the
         Captain, who stared back blankly, as if he knew what was coming. He
         let the cigarette fall from his fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Go ahead,&quot; he whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie screamed and lunged with a windmill swing, and the two men fell
         off the tree branch and tumbled through limbs and vines, wrestling and
         falling all the way down.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;WHY? YOU BASTARD! You bastard! Not you! WHY?&quot; They were
         grappling now on the muddy earth. Eddie strad&shy;dled the
         Captain&#39;s chest, pummeling him with blows to the face. The Captain
         did not bleed. Eddie shook him by the collar and banged his skull
         against the mud. The Captain did not blink. Instead, he rolled from
         side to side with each punch, allowing Eddie his rage. Finally, with
         one arm, he grabbed Eddie and flipped him over.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Because,&quot; he said calmly, his elbow across Eddie&#39;s
         chest, &quot;we would have lost you in that fire. You would have died.
         And it wasn&#39;t your time.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie panted hard. &quot;My . . . time?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain continued. &quot;You were obsessed with get&shy;ting in
         there. You damn near knocked Morton out when he tried to stop you. We
         had a minute to get out and, damn your strength, you were too tough to
         fight.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie felt a final surge of rage and grabbed the Captain by the
         collar. He pulled him close. He saw the teeth stained yellow by
         tobacco. &quot;My . . . leggggg!&quot; Eddie seethed. &quot;My
         <em>life!&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I took your leg,&quot; the Captain said, quietly, &quot;to save
         your life.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie let go and fell back exhausted. His arms ached. His head was
         spinning. For so many years, he had been haunted by that one moment,
         that one mistake, when his whole life changed.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;There was nobody in that hut. What was I <em>thinking</em>? If
         only I didn&#39;t go in there . . .&quot; His voice dropped to a
         whis&shy;per. &quot;Why didn&#39;t I just die?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No one gets left behind, remember?&quot; the Captain said.
         &quot;What happened to you&mdash;I&#39;ve seen it happen before. A
         sol&shy;dier reaches a certain point and then he can&#39;t go anymore.
         Sometimes it&#39;s in the middle of the night. A man&#39;ll just roll
         out of his tent and start walking, barefoot, half naked, like he&#39;s
         going home, like he lives just around the corner.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Sometimes it&#39;s in the middle of a fight. Man&#39;ll drop his
         gun, and his eyes go blank. He&#39;s just done. Can&#39;t fight
         anymore. Usually he gets shot.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Your case, it just so happened, you snapped in front of a fire
         about a minute before we were done with this place. I couldn&#39;t let
         you burn alive. I figured a leg wound would heal. We pulled you out of
         there, and the others got you to a medical unit.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie&#39;s breathing smacked like a hammer in his chest. His head was
         smeared with mud and leaves. It took him a minute to realize the last
         thing the Captain had said.&quot;The others?&quot; Eddie said.
         &quot;What do you mean, &#39;the <em>others&#39;</em>?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain rose. He brushed a twig from his leg.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Did you ever see me again?&quot; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie had not. He had been airlifted to the military hospital, and
         eventually, because of his handicap, was dis&shy;charged and flown
         home to America. He had heard, months later, that the Captain had not
         made it, but he figured it was some later combat with some other unit.
         A let&shy;ter arrived eventually, with a medal inside, but Eddie put
         it away, unopened. The months after the war were dark and brooding,
         and he forgot details and had no interest in col&shy;lecting them. In
         time, he changed his address.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s like I told you,&quot; the Captain said. &quot;Tetanus?
         Yel&shy;low fever? All those shots? Just a big waste of my time.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He nodded in a direction over Eddie&#39;s shoulder, and Eddie turned
         to look.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         WHAT HE SAW, suddenly, was no longer the barren hills but the night of
         their escape, the hazy moon in the sky, the planes coming in, the huts
         on fire. The Captain was driv&shy;ing the transport with Smitty,
         Morton, and Eddie inside. Eddie was across the backseat, burned,
         wounded, semicon&shy;scious, as Morton tied a tourniquet above his
         knee. The shelling was getting closer. The black sky lit up every few
         seconds, as if the sun were flickering on and off. The trans&shy;port
         swerved as it reached the top of a hill, then stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
         There was a gate, a makeshift thing of wood and wire, but because the
         ground dropped off sharply on both sides, they could not go around it.
         The Captain grabbed a rifle and jumped out. He shot the lock and
         pushed the gate open. He motioned for Morton to take the wheel, then
         pointed to his eyes, signaling he would check the path ahead, which
         curled into a thicket of trees. He ran, as best he could in his bare
         feet, 50 yards beyond the turn in the road.
      </p>
      <p>
         The path was clear. He waved to his men. A plane zoomed overhead and
         he lifted his eyes to see whose side it was. It was at that moment,
         while he was looking to the heavens, that a small click sounded
         beneath his right foot.
      </p>
      <p>
         The land mine exploded instantly, like a burping flame from the
         earth&#39;s core. It blew the Captain 20 feet into the air and split
         him into pieces, one fiery lump of bone and gristle and a hundred
         chunks of charred flesh, some of which flew over the muddy earth and
         landed in the banyan trees.

      <h3>
         The Second Lesson
      </h3>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>AW</em>, JESUS,&quot; EDDIE SAID, CLOSING HIS EYES, dropping
         his head backward. &#39;Aw, God. Aw, God! I had no idea, sir. It&#39;s
         sick. It&#39;s awful!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain nodded and looked away. The hills had returned to their
         barren state, the animal bones and the bro&shy;ken cart and the
         smoldering remains of the village. Eddie realized this was the
         Captain&#39;s burial ground. No funeral. No coffin. Just his shattered
         skeleton and the muddy earth.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You&#39;ve been waiting here all this time?&quot; Eddie
         whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Time,&quot; the Captain said, &quot;is not what you think.&quot;
         He sat down next to Eddie. &quot;Dying? Not the end of
         every&shy;thing. We think it is. But what happens on earth is only the
         beginning.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked lost.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I figure it&#39;s like in the Bible, the Adam and Eve
         deal?&quot; the Captain said. &quot;Adam&#39;s first night on earth?
         When he lays down to sleep? He thinks it&#39;s all over, right? He
         doesn&#39;t know what sleep is. His eyes are closing and he thinks
         he&#39;s leaving this world, right?
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Only he isn&#39;t. He wakes up the next morning and he has a
         fresh new world to work with, but he has something else, too. He has
         his yesterday.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain grinned. &quot;The way I see it, that&#39;s what we&#39;re
         getting here, soldier. That&#39;s what heaven is. You get to make
         sense of your yesterdays.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He took out his plastic cigarette pack and tapped it with his finger.
         &quot;You followin&#39; this? I was never all that hot at
         teaching.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie watched the Captain closely. He had always thought of him as so
         much older. But now, with some of the coal ash rubbed from his face,
         Eddie noticed the scant lines on his skin and the full head of dark
         hair. He must have only been in his 30s.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You been here since you died,&quot; Eddie said, &quot;but
         that&#39;s twice as long as you lived.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain nodded.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I&#39;ve been waitin&#39; for you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked down.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;That&#39;s what the Blue Man said.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Well, <em>he</em> was too. He was part of your life, part of why
         you lived and how you lived, part of the story you needed to know, but
         he told you and he&#39;s beyond here now, and in a short bit, I&#39;m
         gonna be as well. So listen up. Because here&#39;s what you need to
         know from me.&quot; Eddie felt his back straighten.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;SACRIFICE,&quot; THE CAPTAIN said. &quot;You made one. I made
         one. We all make them. But you were angry over yours. You kept
         thinking about what you lost.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You didn&#39;t get it. Sacrifice is a part of life. It&#39;s
         <em>supposed</em> to be. It&#39;s not something to regret. It&#39;s
         something to <em>aspire</em> to. Little sacrifices. Big sacrifices. A
         mother works so her son can go to school. A daughter moves home to
         take care of her sick father.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;A man goes to war. . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He stopped for a moment and looked off into the cloudy gray sky.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Rabozzo didn&#39;t die for nothing, you know. He sacri&shy;ficed
         for his country, and his family knew it, and his kid brother went on
         to be a good soldier and a great man because he was inspired by it.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I didn&#39;t die for nothing, either. That night, we might have
         all driven over that land mine. Then the four of us would have been
         gone.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie shook his head. &quot;But you . . .&quot; He lowered his voice.
         &quot;You lost your life.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain smacked his tongue on his teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;That&#39;s the thing. Sometimes when you sacrifice
         some&shy;thing precious, you&#39;re not really losing it. You&#39;re
         just passing it on to someone else.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain walked over to the helmet, rifle, and dog tags, the
         symbolic grave, still stuck in the ground. He placed the helmet and
         tags under one arm, then plucked the rifle from the mud and threw it
         like a javelin. It never landed. Just soared into the sky and
         disappeared. The Captain turned.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I shot you, all right,&quot; he said, &quot;and you lost
         some&shy;thing, but you gained something as well. You just don&#39;t
         know it yet. I gained something, too.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I got to keep my promise. I didn&#39;t leave you behind.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He held out his palm.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Forgive me about the leg?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie thought for a moment. He thought about the bitterness after his
         wounding, his anger at all he had given up. Then he thought of what
         the Captain had given up and he felt ashamed. He offered his hand. The
         Captain gripped it tightly.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been waiting for.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Suddenly, the thick vines dropped off the banyan branches and melted
         with a hiss into the ground. New, healthy branches emerged in a
         yawning spread, covered in smooth, leathery leaves and pouches of
         figs. The Captain only glanced up, as if he&#39;d been expecting it.
         Then, using his open palms, he wiped the remaining ash from his face.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Captain?&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yeah?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Why here? You can pick anywhere to wait, right? That&#39;s what
         the Blue Man said. So why this place?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain smiled. &quot;Because I died in battle. I was killed in
         these hills. I left the world having known almost nothing but
         war&mdash;war talk, war plans, a war family.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;My wish was to see what the world looked like <em>without</em> a
         war. Before we started killing each other.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked around. &quot;But this <em>is</em> war.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;To you. But our eyes are different,&quot; the Captain said.
         &quot;What you see ain&#39;t what I see.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He lifted a hand and the smoldering landscape transformed. The rubble
         melted, trees grew and spread, the ground turned from mud to lush,
         green grass. The murky clouds pulled apart like curtains, revealing a
         sapphire sky. A light, white mist fell in above the treetops, and a
         peach-colored sun hung brilliantly above the horizon, reflected in the
         sparkling oceans that now surrounded the island. It was pure,
         unspoiled, untouched beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked up at his old commanding officer, whose face was clean
         and whose uniform was suddenly pressed.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;This,&quot; the Captain said, raising his arms, &quot;is what I
         see.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He stood for a moment, taking it in.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;By the way, I don&#39;t smoke anymore. That was all in your
         eyes, too.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Why would I smoke in heaven?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He began to walk off.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Wait,&quot; Eddie yelled. &quot;I gotta know something. My
         death. At the pier. Did I save that girl? I felt her hands, but I
         can&#39;t remember&mdash;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain turned and Eddie swallowed his words, embarrassed to even
         be asking, given the horrible way the Captain had died.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I just want to know, that&#39;s all,&quot; he mumbled.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Captain scratched behind his ear. He looked at Eddie
         sympathetically. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you, soldier.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie dropped his head.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;But someone can.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He tossed the helmet and tags. &quot;Yours.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked down. Inside the helmet flap was a crumpled photo of a
         woman that made his heart ache all over again. When he looked up, the
         Captain was gone.

         The morning after the accident, Dominguez came to the shop early,
         skipping his routine of picking up a bagel and a soft drink for
         breakfast. The park was closed, but he came in anyhow, and he turned
         on the water at the sink. He ran his hands under the flow, thinking he
         would clean some of the ride parts. Then he shut off the water and
         abandoned the idea. It seemed twice as quiet as it had a minute ago.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Willie was at the shop door. He wore a green tank top and baggy jeans.
         He held a newspaper. The headline read &#39;Amusement Park
         Tragedy.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Hard time sleeping,&quot; Dominguez said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yeah.&quot; Willie slumped onto a metal stool. &quot;Me,
         too.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He spun a half circle on the stool, looking blankly at the paper.
         &quot;When you think they&#39;ll open us up again?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Dominguez shrugged. &#39;Ask the police.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         They sat quietly for a while, shifting their postures as if taking
         turns. Dominguez sighed. Willie reached inside his shirt pocket,
         fishing for a stick of gum. It was Monday. It was morning. They were
         waiting for the old man to come in and get the workday started.

      <h3>
         The Third Person Eddie Meets in Heaven
      </h3>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>A</em> SUDDEN WIND LIFTED EDDIE, AND HE spun like a pocket watch
         on the end of a chain. An explosion of smoke en&shy;gulfed him,
         swallowing his body in a flume of colors. The sky seemed to pull in,
         until he could feel it touching his skin like a gathered blanket. Then
         it shot away and ex&shy;ploded into jade. Stars appeared, millions of
         stars, like salt sprinkled across the greenish firmament.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie blinked. He was in the mountains now, but the most remarkable
         mountains, a range that went on forever, with snow-capped peaks,
         jagged rocks, and sheer purple slopes. In a flat between two crests
         was a large, black lake. A moon reflected brightly in its water.
      </p>
      <p>
         Down the ridge, Eddie noticed a flickering of colored light that
         changed rhythmically, every few seconds. He stepped in that
         direction&mdash;and realized he was ankle-deep in snow. He lifted his
         foot and shook it hard. The flakes fell loose, glistening with a
         golden sheen. When he touched them, they were neither cold nor wet.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Where am I now</em>? Eddie thought. Once again, he took stock of
         his body, pressing on his shoulders, his chest, his stomach. His arm
         muscles remained tight, but his midsection was looser, flabbier. He
         hesitated, then squeezed his left knee. It throbbed in pain and Eddie
         winced. He had hoped upon leaving the Captain that the wound would
         dis&shy;appear. Instead, it seemed he was becoming the man he&#39;d
         been on earth, scars and fat and all. Why would heaven make you relive
         your own decay?
      </p>
      <p>
         He followed the flickering lights down the narrow ridge. This
         landscape, stark and silent, was breathtaking, more like how he&#39;d
         imagined heaven. He wondered, for a moment, if he had somehow
         finished, if the Captain had been wrong, if there were no more people
         to meet. He came through the snow around a rock ledge to the large
         clearing from which the lights originated. He blinked again&mdash;this
         time in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
         There, in the snowy field, sitting by itself, was a boxcar-shaped
         building with a stainless steel exterior and a red barrel roof. A sign
         above it blinked the word: &quot;<em>EAT</em>.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         A diner.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie had spent many hours in places like this. They all looked the
         same&mdash;high-backed booths, shiny countertops, a row of
         small-parted windows across the front, which, from the outside, made
         customers appear like riders in a railroad car. Eddie could make out
         figures through those windows now, people talking and gesturing. He
         walked up the snowy steps to the double-paned door. He peered inside.
      </p>
      <p>
         An elderly couple was sitting to his right, eating pie; they took no
         notice of him. Other customers sat in swivel chairs at the marble
         counter or inside booths with their coats on hooks. They appeared to
         be from different decades: Eddie saw a woman with a 1930s
         high-collared dress and a long&shy;haired young man with a 1960s peace
         sign tattooed on his arm. Many of the patrons appeared to have been
         wounded. A black man in a work shirt was missing an arm. A teenage
         girl had a deep gash across her face. None of them looked over when
         Eddie rapped on the window. He saw cooks wearing white paper hats, and
         plates of steaming food on the counter awaiting serving&mdash;food in
         the most succulent colors: deep red sauces, yellow butter creams. His
         eyes moved along to the last booth in the right-hand corner. He froze.
      </p>
      <p>
         What he saw, he could not have seen.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;NO,&quot; HE HEARD himself whisper. He turned back from the
         door. He drew deep breaths. His heart pounded. He spun around and
         looked again, then banged wildly on the windowpanes.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No!&quot; Eddie yelled. &quot;No! No!&quot; He banged until he
         was sure the glass would break. &quot;No!&quot; He kept yelling until
         the word he wanted, a word he hadn&#39;t spoken in decades, finally
         formed in his throat. He screamed that word then&mdash;he screamed it
         so loudly that his head throbbed. But the figure inside the booth
         remained hunched over, oblivious, one hand resting on the table, the
         other holding a cigar, never looking up, no matter how many times
         Eddie howled it, over and over again: &quot;Dad! Dad! Dad!&quot;

      </h3>
      <p>
         <em>In the dim and sterile hallway of the V.A. hospital, Eddie&#39;s
         mother opens the white bakery box and rearranges the candles on the
         cake, making them even, 12 on one side, 12 on the other. The rest of
         them&mdash;Eddie&#39;s father, Joe, Marguerite, Mickey
         Shea&mdash;stand around her, watching.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Does anyone have a match?&quot;she whispers.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>They pat their pockets. Mickey fishes a pack from his jacket,
         dropping two loose cigarettes on the floor. Eddie&#39;s mother lights
         the candles. An elevator pings down the hall. A gurney emerges.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&#39;All right then, lets go, &quot;she says.</em>

      <p>
         <em>The soldier in the next bed wakes up yelling, &quot;WHAT THE
         HELL?&quot; He realizes where he is and drops back down, embarrassed.
         The song, once interrupted, seems too heavy to lift again, and only
         Eddie&#39;s mother&#39;s voice, shaking in its solitude, is able to
         continue.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Happy birthday dear Ed-die...&quot; then quickly,

         <em>Eddie props himself against a pillow. His burns are bandaged. His
         leg is in a long cast. There is a pair of crutches by the bed. He
         looks at these faces and he is consumed by a desire to run away.</em>

      <p>
         <em>Joe clears his throat. &quot;Well, hey, you look, pretty

      <p>
         ALL PARENTS DAMAGE their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like
         pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents
         smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged
         little pieces, beyond repair.
      </p>
      <p>
         The damage done by Eddie&#39;s father was, at the begin&shy;ning, the
         damage of neglect. As an infant, Eddie was rarely held by the man, and
         as a child, he was mostly grabbed by the arm, less with love than with
         annoyance. Eddie&#39;s mother handed out the tenderness; his father
         was there for the dis&shy;cipline.
      </p>
      <p>
         On Saturdays, Eddie&#39;s father took him to the pier. Ed&shy;die
         would leave the apartment with visions of carousels and globs of
         cotton candy, but after an hour or so, his father would find a
         familiar face and say, &quot;Watch the kid for me, will ya?&quot;
         Until his father returned, usually late in the after&shy;noon, often
         drunk, Eddie stayed in the custody of an acro&shy;bat or an animal
         trainer.
      </p>
      <p>
         Still, for countless hours of his boardwalk youth, Ed&shy;die waited
         for his father&#39;s attention, sitting on railings or squatting in
         his short pants atop tool chests in the repair shop. Often he&#39;d
         say, &quot;I can help, I can help!&quot; but the only job entrusted
         him was crawling beneath the Ferris wheel in the morning, before the
         park opened, to collect the coins that had fallen from customers&#39;
         pockets the night before.
      </p>
      <p>
         At least four evenings a week, his father played cards. The table had
         money, bottles., cigarettes, and rules. Eddie&#39;s rule was simple:
         Do not disturb. Once he tried to stand next to his father and look at
         his cards, but the old man put down his cigar and erupted like
         thunder, smacking Ed&shy;die&#39;s face with the back of his hand.
         &quot;Stop breathing on me,&quot; he said. Eddie burst into tears and
         his mother pulled him to her waist, glaring at her husband. Eddie
         never got that close again.
      </p>
      <p>
         Other nights, when the cards went bad and the bottles had been emptied
         and his mother was already asleep, his father brought his thunder into
         Eddie and Joe&#39;s bedroom. He raked through the meager toys, hurling
         them against the wall. Then he made his sons lie facedown on the
         mattress while he pulled off his belt and lashed their rear ends,
         screaming that they were wasting his money on junk. Eddie used to pray
         for his mother to wake up, but even the times she did, his father
         warned her to &quot;stay out of it.&quot; Seeing her in the hallway,
         clutching her robe, as helpless as he was, made it all even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
         The hands on Eddie&#39;s childhood glass then were hard and calloused
         and red with anger, and he went through his younger years whacked,
         lashed, and beaten. This was the second damage done, the one after
         neglect. The damage of violence. It got so that Eddie could tell by
         the thump of the footsteps coming down the hall how hard he was going
         to get it.
      </p>
      <p>
         Through it all, despite it all, Eddie privately adored his old man,
         because sons will adore their fathers through even the worst behavior.
         It is how they learn devotion. Before he can devote himself to God or
         a woman, a boy will devote himself to his father, even foolishly, even
         beyond explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         AND ON OCCASION, as if to feed the weakest embers of a fire,
         Eddie&#39;s father let a wrinkle of pride crack the veneer of his
         disinterest. At the baseball field by the 14th Avenue schoolyard, his
         father stood behind the fence, watching Eddie play. If Eddie smacked
         the ball to the outfield, his father nodded, and when he did, Eddie
         leaped around the bases. Other times, when Eddie came home from an
         alley fight, his father would notice his scraped knuckles or split
         lip. He would ask, &quot;What happened to the other guy?&quot; and
         Eddie would say he got him good. This, too, met with his father&#39;s
         approval. When Eddie attacked the kids who were bothering his
         brother&mdash;&quot;the hoodlums,&quot; his mother called
         them&mdash;Joe was ashamed and hid in his room, but Eddie&#39;s father
         said, &quot;Never mind him. You&#39;re the strong one. Be your
         brother&#39;s keeper. Don&#39;t let nobody touch him.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         When Eddie started junior high, he mimicked his fa&shy;ther&#39;s
         summer schedule, rising before the sun, working at the park until
         nightfall. At first, he ran the simpler rides, maneuvering the brake
         levers, bringing train cars to a gen&shy;tle stop. In later years, he
         worked in the repair shop. Ed&shy;die&#39;s father would test him with
         maintenance problems. He&#39;d hand him a broken steering wheel and
         say, &quot;Fix it.&quot; He&#39;d point out a tangled chain and say,
         &quot;Fix it.&quot; He&#39;d carry over a rusty fender and some
         sandpaper and say, &quot;Fix it.&quot; And every time, upon completion
         of the task, Eddie would walk the item back to his father and say,
         &quot;It&#39;s fixed.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         At night they would gather at the dinner table, his mother plump and
         sweating, cooking by the stove, his brother, Joe, talking away, his
         hair and skin smelling from seawater. Joe had become a good swimmer,
         and his summer work was at the Ruby Pier pool. Joe talked about all
         the people he saw there, their swimsuits, their money. Eddie&#39;s
         father was not impressed. Once Eddie overheard him talking to his
         mother about Joe. &quot;That one,&quot; he said, &quot;ain&#39;t tough
         enough for anything but water.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Still, Eddie envied the way his brother looked in the evenings, so
         tanned and clean. Eddie&#39;s fingernails, like his father&#39;s, were
         stained with grease, and at the dinner table Eddie would flick them
         with his thumbnail, trying to get the dirt out. He caught his father
         watching him once and the old man grinned.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Shows you did a hard day&#39;s work,&quot; he said, and he held
         up his own dirty fingernails, before wrapping them around a glass of
         beer.
      </p>
      <p>
         By this point&mdash;already a strapping teenager&mdash;Eddie only
         nodded back. Unbeknownst to him, he had begun the ritual of semaphore
         with his father, forsaking words or physical affection. It was all to
         be done internally. &quot;You were just supposed to know it,
         that&#39;s all. Denial of affection. The damage done.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         AND THEN, ONE night, the speaking stopped alto&shy;gether. This was
         after the war, when Eddie had been re&shy;leased from the hospital and
         the cast had been removed from his leg and he had moved back into the
         family apartment on Beachwood Avenue. His father had been drinking at
         the nearby pub and he came home late to find Eddie asleep on the
         couch. The darkness of combat had left Eddie changed. He stayed
         indoors. He rarely spoke, even to Marguerite. He spent hours staring
         out the kitchen window, watching the carousel ride, rubbing his bad
         knee. His mother whispered that he &quot;just needed time,&quot; but
         his father grew more agitated each day. He didn&#39;t understand
         depression. To him it was weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Get up,&quot; he yelled now, his words slurring, &quot;and get a
         job.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie stirred. His father yelled again.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Get up ... and get a job!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The old man was wobbling, but he came toward Eddie and pushed him.
         &quot;Get up and get a job! Get up and get a job! Get up ... and ...
         <em>GET A JOB!&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie rose to his elbows.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Get up and get a job! Get up and&mdash;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Eddie yelled, surging to his feet, ignor&shy;ing
         the burst of pain in his knee. He glared at his father, his face just
         inches away. He could smell the bad breath of alcohol and cigarettes.
      </p>
      <p>
         The old man glanced at Eddie&#39;s leg. His voice lowered to a growl.
         &quot;See? You . . . ain&#39;t... so ... hurt.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He reeled back to throw a punch, but Eddie moved on instinct and
         grabbed his father&#39;s arm mid-swing. The old man&#39;s eyes
         widened. This was the first time Eddie had ever defended himself, the
         first time he had ever done anything besides receive a beating as if
         he deserved it. His father looked at his own clenched fist, short of
         its mark, and his nostrils flared and his teeth gritted and he
         staggered back&shy;ward and yanked his arm free. He stared at Eddie
         with the eyes of a man watching a train pull away.,
      </p>
      <p>
         He never spoke to his son again.
      </p>
      <p>
         This was the final handprint on Eddie&#39;s glass. Silence. It haunted
         their remaining years. His father was silent when Ed&shy;die moved
         into his own apartment, silent when Eddie took a cab-driving job,
         silent at Eddie&#39;s wedding, silent when Eddie came to visit his
         mother. She begged and wept and beseeched her husband to change his
         mind, to let it go, but Eddie&#39;s fa&shy;ther would only say to her,
         through a clenched jaw, what he said to others who made the same
         request: &quot;That boy raised a hand to me.&quot; And that was the
         end of the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
         All parents damage their children. This was their life together.
         Neglect. Violence. Silence. And now, someplace beyond death, Eddie
         slumped against a stainless steel wall and dropped into a snowbank,
         stung again by the denial of a man whose love, almost inexplicably, he
         still coveted, a man ignoring him, even in heaven. His father. The
         damage done.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;DON&#39;T BE ANGRY,&quot; a woman&#39;s voice said. &quot;He
         can&#39;t hear you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie jerked his head up. An old woman stood before him in the snow.
         Her face was gaunt, with sagging cheeks, rose-colored lipstick, and
         tightly pulled-back white hair, thin enough in parts to reveal the
         pink scalp beneath it. She wore wire-rimmed spectacles over narrow
         blue eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie could not recall her. Her clothes were before his time, a dress
         made of silk and chiffon, with a bib-like bodice stitched with white
         beads and topped with a velvet bow just below her neck. Her skirt had
         a rhinestone buckle and there were snaps and hooks up the side. She
         stood with el&shy;egant posture, holding a parasol with both hands.
         Eddie guessed she&#39;d been rich.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Not always rich,&quot; she said, grinning as if she&#39;d heard
         him. &quot;I was raised much like you were, in the back end of the
         city, forced to leave school when I was fourteen. I was a working
         girl. So were my sisters. We gave every nickel back to the
         family&mdash;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie interrupted. He didn&#39;t want another story. &quot;Why
         can&#39;t my father hear me?&quot; he demanded.
      </p>
      <p>
         She smiled. &quot;Because his spirit&mdash;safe and sound&mdash;is
         part of my eternity. But he is not really here. You are.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Why does my father have to be safe for <em>you</em>?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She paused.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Come,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         SUDDENLY THEY WERE at the bottom of the mountain. The light from the
         diner was now just a speck, like a star that had fallen into a
         crevice.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Beautiful, isn&#39;t it?&quot; the old woman said. Eddie
         fol&shy;lowed her eyes. There was something about her, as if he&#39;d
         seen her photograph somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Are you ... my third person?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I am at that,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie rubbed his head. <em>Who was this woman</em>? At least with the
         Blue Man, at least with the Captain, he had some recollection of their
         place in his life. Why a stranger? Why now? Eddie had once hoped death
         would mean a reunion with those who went before him. He had attended
         so many funerals, polishing his black dress shoes, finding his hat,
         standing in a cemetery with the same despairing question: <em>Why are
         they gone and I&#39;m still here</em>? His mother. His brother. His
         aunts and uncles. His buddy Noel. Marguerite. &quot;One day,&quot; the
         priest would say, &quot;we will all be together in the Kingdom of
         Heaven.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Where were they, then, if this was heaven? Eddie stud&shy;ied this
         strange older woman. He felt more alone than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Can I see Earth?&quot; he whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         She shook her head no.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Can I talk to God?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You can always do that.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He hesitated before asking the next question.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Can I go back?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She squinted. &quot;Back?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yeah, back,&quot; Eddie said. &quot;To my life. To that last
         day. Is there something I can do? Can I promise to be good? Can I
         promise to go to church all the time? Something?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Why?&quot; She seemed amused.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Why?&quot; Eddie repeated. He swiped at the snow that had no
         cold, with the bare hand that felt no moisture. &quot;Why? Because
         this place don&#39;t make no sense to me. Be&shy;cause I don&#39;t
         feel like no angel, if that&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to feel like.
         Because I don&#39;t feel like I got it all figured out. I can&#39;t
         even remember my own death. I can&#39;t remember the accident. All I
         remember are these two little hands&mdash;this lit&shy;tle girl I was
         trying to save, see? I was pulling her out of the way and I
         must&#39;ve grabbed her hands and that&#39;s when I ...&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He shrugged.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Died?&quot; the old woman said, smiling. &quot;Passed away?
         Moved on? Met your Maker?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Died,&quot; he said, exhaling. &quot;And that&#39;s all I
         remember. Then you, the others, all this. Ain&#39;t you supposed to
         have peace when you die?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You have peace,&quot; the old woman said, &quot;when you make it
         with yourself.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Nah,&quot; Eddie said, shaking his head. &quot;Nah, you
         don&#39;t.&quot; He thought about telling her the agitation he&#39;d
         felt every day since the war, the bad dreams, the inability to get
         excited about much of anything, the times he went to the docks alone
         and watched the fish pulled in by the wide rope nets, embarrassed
         because he saw himself in those helpless, flop&shy;ping creatures,
         snared and beyond escape.
      </p>
      <p>
         He didn&#39;t tell her that. Instead he said, &quot;No offense, lady,
         but I don&#39;t even know you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;But I know you,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie sighed.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Oh yeah? How&#39;s that?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;if you have a moment.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         SHE SAT DOWN then, although there was nothing to sit on. She simply
         rested on the air and crossed her legs, lady&shy;like, keeping her
         spine straight. The long skirt folded neatly around her. A breeze
         blew, and Eddie caught the faint scent of perfume.
      </p>
      <p>
         &#39;As I mentioned, I was once a working girl. My job was serving
         food in a place called the Seahorse Grille. It was near the ocean
         where you grew up. Perhaps you remember it?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She nodded toward the diner, and it all came back to Eddie. Of course.
         That place. He used to eat breakfast there. A greasy spoon, they
         called it. They&#39;d torn it down years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You?&quot; Eddie said, almost laughing. &quot;You were a
         wait&shy;ress at the Seahorse?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Indeed,&quot; she said, proudly. &quot;I served dockworkers
         their coffee and longshoremen their crab cakes and bacon.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I was an attractive girl in those years, I might add. I turned
         away many a proposal. My sisters would scold me. &#39;Who are you to
         be so choosy?&#39; they would say. &#39;Find a man before it&#39;s too
         late.&#39;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Then one morning, the finest-looking gentleman I had ever seen
         walked through the door. He wore a chalk-stripe suit and a derby hat.
         His dark hair was neatly cut and his mustache covered a constant
         smile. He nodded when I served him and I tried not to stare. But when
         he spoke with his colleague, I could hear his heavy, confident
         laughter. Twice I caught him looking in my direction. When he paid his
         bill, he said his name was Emile and he asked if he might call on me.
         And I knew, right then, my sisters would no longer have to hound me
         for a decision.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Our courtship was exhilarating, for Emile was a man of means. He
         took me places I had never been, bought me clothes I had never
         imagined, paid for meals I had never ex&shy;perienced in my poor,
         sheltered life. Emile had earned his wealth quickly, from investments
         in lumber and steel. He was a spender, a risk taker&mdash;he went over
         the boards when he got an idea. I suppose that is why he was drawn to
         a poor girl like me. He abhorred those who were born into wealth, and
         rather enjoyed doing things the &#39;sophisticated people&#39; would
         never do.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;One of those things was visiting seaside resorts. He loved the
         attractions, the salty food, the gypsies and for&shy;tune-tellers and
         weight guessers and diving girls. And we both loved the sea. One day,
         as we sat in the sand, the tide rolling gently to our feet, he asked
         for my hand in marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I was overjoyed. I told him yes and we heard the sounds of
         children playing in the ocean. Emile went over the boards again and
         swore that soon he would build a re&shy;sort park just for me, to
         capture the happiness of this mo&shy;ment&mdash;to stay eternally
         young.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The old woman smiled. &quot;Emile kept his promise. A few years later,
         he made a deal with the railroad company, which was looking for a way
         to increase its riders on the weekend. That&#39;s how most amusement
         parks were built, you know.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie nodded. He knew. Most people didn&#39;t. They thought amusement
         parks were constructed by elves, built with candy canes. In fact, they
         were simply business opportunities for railroad companies, who erected
         them at the final stops of routes, so commuters would have a reason to
         ride on weekends, <i>You</i> <em>know where I work</em>? Eddie used to
         say. <em>The end of the line. That&#39;s where I work.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Emile,&quot; the old woman continued, &quot;built the most
         wonderful place, a massive pier using timber and steel he already
         owned. Then came the magical attractions&mdash;races and rides and
         boat trips and tiny railways. There was a carousel im&shy;ported from
         France and a Ferris wheel from one of the inter&shy;national
         exhibitions in Germany. There were towers and spires and thousands of
         incandescent lights, so bright that at night, you could see the park
         from a ship&#39;s deck on the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Emile hired hundreds of workers, municipal workers and carnival
         workers and foreign workers. He brought in an&shy;imals and acrobats
         and clowns. The entrance was the last thing finished, and it was truly
         grand. Everyone said so. When it was complete, he took me there with a
         cloth blind&shy;fold over my eyes. When he removed the blindfold, I
         saw it.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The old woman took a step back from Eddie. She looked at him
         curiously, as if she were disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The entrance?&quot; she said. &quot;Don&#39;t you remember?
         Didn&#39;t you ever wonder about the name? Where you worked? Where
         your father worked?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She touched her chest softly with her white-gloved fingers. Then she
         dipped, as if formally introducing herself.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I,&quot; she said, &quot;am Ruby.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>
         Today Is Eddie&#39;s Birthday
      </h3>
      <p>
         <em>He is 33. He wakes with a jolt, gasping for breath. His thick,
         black hair is matted with sweat. He blinks hard against the darkness,
         try&shy;ing desperately to focus on his arm, his knuckles, anything to
         know that he is here, in the apartment over the bakery, and not back
         in the war, in the village, in the fire. That dream. Will it ever
         stop?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>It is just before 4 A.M. No point in going back to sleep. He waits
         until his breathing subsides, then slowly rolls off the bed, trying
         not to wake his wife. He puts his right leg down first, out of habit,
         avoid&shy;ing the inevitable stiffness of his left. Eddie begins every
         morning the same way. One step and one hobble.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>In the bathroom, he checks his bloodshot eyes and splashes water
         on his face. It is always the same dream: Eddie wandering through the
         flames in the Philippines on his last night of war. The village huts
         are engulfed in fire, and there is a constant, high-pitched squealing
         noise. Something invisible hits Eddie&#39;s legs and he swats at it
         but misses, and then swats again and misses again. The flames grow
         more intense, roaring like an engine, and then Smitty appears, yelling
         for Eddie, yelling, &quot;Come on! Come on!&quot; Eddie tries to speak
         but when he opens his mouth, the high-pitched squeal emerges from his
         throat. Then something grabs his legs, pulling him under the muddy
         earth.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>And then he wakes up. Sweating. Panting. Always the same. The
         worst part is not the sleeplessness. The worst part is the general
         darkness the dream leaves over him, a gray film that clouds the day.
         Even his happy moments feel encased, like holes jabbed in a hard sheet
         of ice.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>He dresses quietly and goes down the stairs. The taxi is parked by
         the corner, its usual spot, and Eddie wipes the moisture from its
         windshield. He never speaks about the darkness to Marguerite. She
         strokes his hair and says, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; and he says,
         &quot;Nothing, I&#39;m just beat,&quot; and leaves it at that. How can
         he explain such sad&shy;ness when she is supposed to make him happy?
         The truth is he can&shy;not explain it himself. All he knows is that
         something stepped in front of him, blocking his way, until in time he
         gave up on things, he gave up studying engineering and he gave up on
         the idea of trav&shy;eling. He sat down in his life. And there he
         remained.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>This night, when Eddie returns from work, he parks the taxi by the
         corner. He comes slowly up the stairs. From his apartment, he hears
         music, a familiar song.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You made me love you
      </p>
      <p>
         I didn&#39;t want to do it,
      </p>
      <p>
         I didn&#39;t want to do it. . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>He opens the door to see a cake on the table and a small white
         bag, tied with ribbon.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Honey?&quot; Marguerite yells from the bedroom. &quot;Is
         that you?&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>He lifts the white bag. Taffy. From the pier.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Happy birthday to you... &quot; Marguerite emerges, singing
         in her soft sweet voice. She looks beautiful, wearing the print dress
         Ed&shy;die likes, her hair and lips done up. Eddie feels the need to
         inhale, as if undeserving of such a moment. He fights the darkness
         within him</em>, &quot;Leave me alone,&quot; <em>he tells it</em>.
         &quot;Let me feel this the way I should feel it.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Marguerite finishes the song and kisses him on the lips.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Want to fight me for the taffy?&quot; she whispers.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>He moves to kiss her again. Someone raps on the door.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Eddie! Are you in there? Eddie?&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Mr. Nathanson, the baker, lives in the ground-level apartment
         behind the store. He has a telephone. When Eddie opens the door, he is
         standing in the doorway, wearing a bathrobe. He looks concerned.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Eddie</em>,&quot; <em>he says. &quot;Come down. There&#39;s
         a phone call. I think something happened to your father</em>.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <hr>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         I AM RUBY.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         It suddenly made sense to Eddie, why the woman looked familiar. He had
         seen a photograph, somewhere in the back of the repair shop, among the
         old manuals and paperwork from the park&#39;s initial ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The old entrance . . .&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         She nodded in satisfaction. The original Ruby Pier en&shy;trance had
         been something of a landmark, a giant arching structure based on a
         historic French temple, with fluted columns and a coved dome at the
         top. Just beneath that dome, under which all patrons would pass, was
         the painted face of a beautiful woman. This woman. Ruby.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;But that thing was destroyed a long time ago,&quot; Eddie said.
         &quot;There was a big . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He paused.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Fire,&quot; the old woman said. &quot;Yes. A very big
         fire.&quot; She dropped her chin, and her eyes looked down through her
         spectacles, as if she were reading from her lap.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It was Independence Day, the Fourth of July&mdash;a
         holi&shy;day. Emile loved holidays. &#39;Good for business,&#39;
         he&#39;d say. If Independence Day went well, the entire summer might
         go well. So Emile arranged for fireworks. He brought in a marching
         band. He even hired extra workers, roustabouts mostly, just for that
         weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;But something happened the night before the celebration. It was
         hot, even after the sun went down, and a few of the roustabouts chose
         to sleep outside, behind the work sheds. They lit a fire in a metal
         barrel to roast their food.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;As the night went on, there was drinking and carous&shy;ing. The
         workers got ahold of some of the smaller fire&shy;works. They set them
         off. The wind blew. The sparks flew. Everything in those days was made
         of lathe and tar. . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She shook her head. &quot;The rest happened quickly. The fire spread
         to the midway and the food stalls and on to the animal cages. The
         roustabouts ran off. By the time someone came to our home to wake us,
         Ruby Pier was in flames. From our window we saw the horrible orange
         blaze. We heard the horses&#39; hooves and the steamer engines of the
         fire compa&shy;nies. People were in the street.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I begged Emile not to go, but that was fruitless. Of course he
         would go. He would go to the raging fire and he would try to salvage
         his years of work and he would lose himself in anger and fear and when
         the entrance caught fire, the entrance with my name and my picture, he
         lost all sense of where he was, too. He was trying to throw buckets of
         water when a column collapsed upon him.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She put her fingers together and raised them to her lips. &quot;In the
         course of one night, our lives were changed forever. Risk taker that
         he was, Emile had acquired only mini&shy;mal insurance on the pier. He
         lost his fortune. His splendid gift to me was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;In desperation, he sold the charred grounds to a businessman
         from Pennsylvania for far less than it was worth. That businessman
         kept the name, Ruby Pier, and in time, he reopened the park. But it
         was not ours anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Emile&#39;s spirit was as broken as his body. It took three
         years before he could walk on his own. We moved away, to a place
         outside the city, a small flat, where our lives were spent modestly,
         me tending to my wounded husband and silently nurturing a single
         wish.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What wish?&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;That he had never built that place.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THE OLD WOMAN sat in silence. Eddie studied the vast jade sky. He
         thought about how many times he had wished this same thing, that
         whoever had built Ruby Pier had done something else with his money.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I&#39;m sorry about your husband,&quot; Eddie said, mostly
         because he didn&#39;t know what else to say.
      </p>
      <p>
         The old woman smiled. &quot;Thank you, dear. But we lived many years
         beyond those flames. We raised three children. Emile was sickly, in
         and out of the hospital. He left me a widow in my fifties. You see
         this face, these wrinkles?&quot; She turned her cheeks upward. &quot;I
         earned every one of them.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t understand. Did we ever . . . meet?
         Did you ever come to the pier?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I never wanted to see the pier again.
         My children went there, and their children and theirs. But not me. My
         idea of heaven was as far from the ocean as pos&shy;sible, back in
         that busy diner, when my days were simple, when Emile was courting
         me.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie rubbed his temples. When he breathed, mist emerged.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;So why am <i>I</i> here?&quot; he said. &quot;I mean, your
         story, the fire, it all happened before I was born.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Things that happen before you are born still affect you,&quot;
         she said. &quot;And people who come before your time af&shy;fect you
         as well.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;We move through places every day that would never have been if
         not for those who came before us. Our workplaces, where we spend so
         much time&mdash;we often think they began with our arrival. That&#39;s
         not true.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She tapped her fingertips together. &quot;If not for Emile, I would
         have no husband. If not for our marriage, there would be no pier. If
         there&#39;d been no pier, you would not have ended up working
         there.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie scratched his head. &quot;So you&#39;re here to tell me about
         work?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No, dear,&quot; Ruby answered, her voice softening.
         &quot;I&#39;m here to tell you why your father died.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THE PHONE CALL was from Eddie&#39;s mother. His father had collapsed
         that afternoon, on the east end of the boardwalk near the Junior
         Rocket Ride. He had a raging fever.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Eddie, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; his mother said, her voice shaking.
         She told him of a night, earlier in the week, when his father had come
         home at dawn, soaking wet. His clothes were full of sand. He was
         missing a shoe. She said he smelled like the ocean. Eddie bet he
         smelled like liquor, too.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;He was coughing,&quot; his mother explained. &quot;It just got
         worse. We should have called a doctor right away. . . .&quot; She
         drifted in her words. He&#39;d gone to work that day, she said, sick
         as he was, with his tool belt and his ball peen hammer&mdash;same as
         always&mdash;but that night he&#39;d refused to eat and in bed
         he&#39;d hacked and wheezed and sweated through his un&shy;dershirt.
         The next day was worse. And now, this afternoon, he&#39;d collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The doctor said it&#39;s pneumonia. Oh, I should have done
         something. I should have <em>done</em> something. . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What were <em>you</em> supposed to do?&quot; Eddie asked. He was
         mad that she took this on herself. It was his father&#39;s drunken
         fault.
      </p>
      <p>
         Through the phone, he heard her crying.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         EDDIE&#39;S FATHER USED to say he&#39;d spent so many years by the
         ocean, he breathed seawater. Now, away from that ocean, in the
         confines of a hospital bed, his body began to wither like a beached
         fish. Complications developed. Congestion built in his chest. His
         condition went from fair to stable and from stable to serious. Friends
         went from saying, &quot;He&#39;ll be home in a day,&quot; to
         &quot;He&#39;ll be home in a week.&quot; In his father&#39;s absence,
         Eddie helped out at the pier, working evenings after his taxi job,
         greasing the tracks, checking the brake pads, testing the levers, even
         repairing broken ride parts in the shop.
      </p>
      <p>
         What he really was doing was protecting his father&#39;s job. The
         owners acknowledged his efforts, then paid him half of what his father
         earned. He gave the money to his mother, who went to the hospital
         every day and slept there most nights. Eddie and Marguerite cleaned
         her apartment and shopped for her food.
      </p>
      <p>
         When Eddie was a teenager, if he ever complained or seemed bored with
         the pier, his father would snap, &quot;What? This ain&#39;t good
         enough for you?&quot; And later, when he&#39;d suggested Eddie take a
         job there after high school, Eddie almost laughed, and his father
         again said, &quot;What? This ain&#39;t good enough for you?&quot; And
         before Eddie went to war, when he&#39;d talked of marrying Marguerite
         and becoming an engineer, his father said, &quot;What? This ain&#39;t
         good enough for you?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         And now, despite all that, here he was, at the pier, do&shy;ing his
         father&#39;s labor.
      </p>
      <p>
         Finally, one night, at his mother&#39;s urging, Eddie visited the
         hospital. He entered the room slowly. His father, who for years had
         refused to speak to Eddie, now lacked the strength to even try. He
         watched his son with heavy-lidded eyes. Eddie, after struggling to
         find even one sentence to say, did the only thing he could think of to
         do: He held up his hands and showed his father his grease-stained
         fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Don&#39;t sweat it, kid,&quot; the other maintenance workers
         told him. &quot;Your old man will pull through. He&#39;s the
         tough&shy;est son of a gun we&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         PARENTS RARELY LET go of their children, so children let go of them.
         They move on. They move away. The moments that used to define
         them&mdash;a mother&#39;s approval, a father&#39;s nod&mdash;are
         covered by moments of their own accomplish&shy;ments. It is not until
         much later, as the skin sags and the heart weakens, that children
         understand; their stories, and all their accomplishments, sit atop the
         stories of their mothers and fathers, stones upon stones, beneath the
         wa&shy;ters of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
         When the news came that his father had died&mdash;&quot;slipped
         away,&quot; a nurse told him, as if he had gone out for
         milk&mdash;Eddie felt the emptiest kind of anger, the kind that
         circles in its cage. Like most workingmen&#39;s sons, Eddie had
         envisioned for his father a heroic death to counter the commonness of
         his life. There was nothing heroic about a drunken stupor by the
         beach.
      </p>
      <p>
         The next day, he went to his parents&#39; apartment, en&shy;tered
         their bedroom, and opened all the drawers, as if he might find a piece
         of his father inside. He rifled through coins, a tie pin, a small
         bottle of apple brandy, rubber bands, electric bills, pens, and a
         cigarette lighter with a mermaid on the side. Finally, he found a deck
         of playing cards. He put it in his pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THE FUNERAL WAS small and brief. In the weeks that followed,
         Eddie&#39;s mother lived in a daze. She spoke to her husband as if he
         were still there. She yelled at him to turn down the radio. She cooked
         enough food for two. She fluffed pillows on both sides of the bed,
         even though only one side had been slept in.
      </p>
      <p>
         One night, Eddie saw her stacking dishes on the countertop.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Let me help you,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No, no,&quot; his mother answered, &quot;your father will put
         them away.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie put a hand on her shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Ma,&quot; he said, softly. &quot;Dad&#39;s gone.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Gone where?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The next day, Eddie went to the dispatcher and told him he was
         quitting. Two weeks later, he and Marguerite moved back into the
         building where Eddie had grown up, Beachwood Avenue&mdash;apartment
         6B&mdash;where the hallways were narrow and the kitchen window viewed
         the carousel and where Eddie had accepted a job that would let him
         keep an eye on his mother, a position he had been groomed for summer
         after summer: a maintenance man at Ruby Pier. Eddie never said
         this&mdash;not to his wife, not to his mother, not to anyone&mdash;but
         he cursed his father for dying and for trapping him in the very life
         he&#39;d been trying to es&shy;cape; a life that, as he heard the old
         man laughing from the grave, apparently now was good enough for him.

         Today Is Eddie&#39;s Birthday
      </h3>
      <p>
         <em>He is 37. His breakfast is getting cold.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;You see any salt?&quot; Eddie asks Noel.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Noel, chewing a mouthful of sausage, slides out from the booth,
         leans across another table, and grabs a salt shaker.</em>

         <em>&quot;What are you, the manager?&quot; Noel says.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie shrugs. The morning is already hot and thick with

         mornings, before the park gets crazy. Noel works in the dry cleaning
         business. Ed&shy;die helped him get the contract for Ruby Pier&#39;s

      <p>
         &quot;<em>What&#39;dya think of this good-lookin&#39; guy?&quot; Noel
         says. He has a copy of</em> Life <em>magazine open to a photo of a
         young political candi&shy;date. &quot;How can this guy run for
         president? He&#39;s a kid</em>!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie shrugs. &quot;He&#39;s about our age.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>No foolin&#39;?&quot; Noel says. He lifts an eyebrow.
         &quot;I thought you had to be older to be president</em>.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;We are older, &quot;Eddie mumbles.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Noel closes the magazine. His voice drops. &quot;Hey. You hear
         what happened at Brighton?&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie nods. He sips his coffee. He&#39;d heard. An amusement park
         A gondola ride. Something snapped. A mother and her son fell 60 feet
         to their death.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;You know anybody up there?&quot;Noel asks.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie puts his tongue between his teeth. Every now and then he
         hears these stories, an accident at a park somewhere, and he
         shud&shy;ders as if a wasp just flew by his ear. Not a day passes that
         he doesn &#39;t worry about it happening here, at Ruby Pier, under his
         watch.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Nuh-uh,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&#39;t know no one in

         <em>He fixes his eyes out the window, as a crowd of beachgoers emerges

         foldable chairs, made from lightweight aluminum.</em>

      <h3>
         The Third Lesson
      </h3>
      <p>
         &quot;WAS THE PIER SO BAD?&quot; THE OLD woman asked.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It wasn&#39;t my choice,&quot; Eddie said, sighing. &quot;My
         mother needed help. One thing led to another. &quot;Years passed. I
         never left. I never lived nowhere else. Never made any real money.
         &quot;You know how it is&mdash;you get used to something, people rely
         on you, one day you wake up and you can&#39;t tell Tuesday from
         Thursday. You&#39;re doing the same boring stuff, you&#39;re a
         &#39;ride man,&#39; just like . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Your father?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie said nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;He was hard on you,&quot; the old woman said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie lowered his eyes. &quot;Yeah. So?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Perhaps you were hard on him, too.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I doubt it. You know the last time he talked to me?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The last time he tried to strike you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie shot her a look.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;And you know the last thing he said to me? &#39;Get a job.&#39;
         Some father, huh?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The old woman pursed her lips. &quot;You began to work after that. You
         picked yourself up.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie felt a rumbling of anger. &quot;Look,&quot; he snapped.
         &quot;You didn&#39;t know the guy.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot; She rose. &quot;But I know something you
         don&#39;t. And it is time to show you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         RUBY POINTED WITH the tip of her parasol and drew a circle in the
         snow. When Eddie looked into the circle, he felt as if his eyes were
         falling from their sockets and travel&shy;ing on their own, down a
         hole and into another moment. The images sharpened. It was years ago,
         in the old apart&shy;ment. He could see front and back, above and
         below.
      </p>
      <p>
         This is what he saw:
      </p>
      <p>
         He saw his mother, looking concerned, sitting at the kitchen table. He
         saw Mickey Shea, sitting across from her. Mickey looked awful. He was
         soaking wet, and he kept rubbing his hands over his forehead and down
         his nose. He began to sob. Eddie&#39;s mother brought him a glass of
         water. She motioned for him to wait, and walked to the bedroom and
         shut the door. She took off her shoes and her house-dress. She reached
         for a blouse and skirt.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie could see all the rooms, but he could not hear what the two of
         them were saying, it was just blurred noise. He saw Mickey, in the
         kitchen, ignoring the glass of water, pulling a flask from his jacket
         and swigging from it. Then, slowly, he got up and staggered to the
         bedroom. He opened the door.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie saw his mother, half dressed, turn in surprise. Mickey was
         wobbling. She pulled a robe around her. Mickey came closer. Her hand
         went out instinctively to block him. Mickey froze, just for an
         instant, then grabbed that hand and grabbed Eddie&#39;s mother and
         backed her into the wall, leaning against her, grabbing her waist. She
         squirmed, then yelled, and pushed on Mickey&#39;s chest while still
         gripping her robe. He was bigger and stronger, and he buried his
         unshaven face below her cheek, smearing tears on her neck.
      </p>
      <p>
         Then the front door opened and Eddie&#39;s father stood there, wet
         from rain, a ball peen hammer hanging from his belt. He ran into the
         bedroom and saw Mickey grabbing his wife. Eddie&#39;s father hollered.
         He raised the ham&shy;mer. Mickey put his hands over his head and
         charged to the door, knocking Eddie&#39;s father sideways. Eddie&#39;s
         mother was crying, her chest heaving, her face streamed with tears.
         Her husband grabbed her shoulders. He shook her violently. Her robe
         fell. They were both screaming. Then Eddie&#39;s father left the
         apartment, smashing a lamp with the hammer on his way out. He thumped
         down the steps and ran off into the rainy night.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;WHAT WAS THAT?&quot; Eddie yelled in disbelief. &quot;What the
         hell was <em>THAT</em>?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The old woman held her tongue. She stepped to the side of the snowy
         circle and drew another one. Eddie tried not to look down. He
         couldn&#39;t help it. He was falling again, be&shy;coming eyes at a
         scene.
      </p>
      <p>
         This is what he saw:
      </p>
      <p>
         He saw a rainstorm at the farthest edge of Ruby Pier&mdash;the
         &quot;north point,&quot; they called it&mdash;a narrow jetty that
         stretched far out into the ocean. The sky was a bluish black. The rain
         was falling in sheets. Mickey Shea came stumbling toward the edge of
         the jetty. He fell to the ground, his stomach heaving in and out. He
         lay there for a moment, face to the darkened sky, then rolled on his
         side, under the wood railing. He dropped into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie&#39;s father appeared moments later, scrambling back and forth,
         the hammer still in his hand. He grabbed the railing, searching the
         waters. The wind blew the rain in sideways. His clothes were drenched
         and his leather tool belt was nearly black from the soaking. He saw
         something in the waves. He stopped, pulled off the belt, yanked off
         one shoe, tried to undo the other, gave up, squatted under the railing
         and jumped, splashing clumsily in the churning ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
         Mickey was bobbing in the insistent roll of seawater, half
         unconscious, a foamy yellow fluid coming from his mouth. Eddie&#39;s
         father swam to him, yelling into the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
         He grabbed Mickey. Mickey swung. Eddie&#39;s father swung back. The
         skies clapped with thunder as the rainwater pelted them. They grabbed
         and flailed in the violent chop.
      </p>
      <p>
         Mickey coughed hard as Eddie&#39;s father grabbed his arm and hooked
         it over his shoulder. He went under, came up again, then braced his
         weight against Mickey&#39;s body, pointing them toward shore. He
         kicked. They moved forward. A wave swept them back. Then forward
         again. The ocean thumped and crashed, but Eddie&#39;s father remained
         wedged under Mickey&#39;s armpit, pumping his legs, blinking wildly to
         clear his vision.
      </p>
      <p>
         They caught the crest of a wave and made sudden progress shoreward.
         Mickey moaned and gasped. Eddie&#39;s fa&shy;ther spit out seawater.
         It seemed to take forever, the rain pop&shy;ping, the white foam
         smacking their faces, the two men grunting, thrashing their arms.
         Finally, a high, curling wave lifted them up and dumped them onto the
         sand, and Eddie&#39;s father rolled out from under Mickey and was able
         to hook his hands under Mickey&#39;s arms and hold him from being
         swept into the surf. When the waves receded, he yanked Mickey forward
         with a final surge, then collapsed on the shore, his mouth open,
         filling with wet sand.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         EDDIE&#39;S VISION RETURNED to his body. He felt exhausted, spent, as
         if he had been in that ocean himself. His head was heavy. Everything
         he thought he&#39;d known about his father, he didn&#39;t seem to know
         anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What was he <em>doing</em>?&quot; Eddie whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Saving a friend,&quot; Ruby said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie glared at her. &quot;Some friend. If I&#39;d have known what he
         did, I&#39;d have let his drunken hide drown.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Your father thought about that, too,&quot; the old woman said.
         &quot;He had chased after Mickey to hurt him, perhaps even to kill
         him. But in the end, he couldn&#39;t. He knew who Mickey was. He knew
         his shortcomings. He knew he drank. He knew his judgment faltered.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;But many years earlier, when your father was looking for work,
         it was Mickey who went to the pier owner and vouched for him. And when
         you were born, it was Mickey who lent your parents what little money
         he had, to help pay for the extra mouth to feed.Your father took old
         friendships seriously&mdash;&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Hold on, lady,&quot; Eddie snapped. &quot;Did you see what that
         bastard was doing with my mother?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I did,&quot; the old woman said sadly. &quot;It was wrong. But
         things are not always what they seem.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Mickey had been fired that afternoon. He&#39;d slept through
         another shift, too drunk to wake up, and his em&shy;ployers told him
         that was enough. He handled the news as he handled all bad news, by
         drinking more, and he was thick with whiskey by the time he reached
         your mother. He was begging for help. He wanted his job back. Your
         father was working late. Your mother was going to take Mickey to him.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Mickey was coarse, but he was not evil. At that moment, he was
         lost, adrift, and what he did was an act of loneliness and
         desperation. He acted on impulse. A bad impulse. Your father acted on
         impulse, too, and while his first impulse was to kill, his final
         impulse was to keep a man alive.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She crossed her hands over the end of her parasol.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;That was how he took ill, of course. He lay there on the beach
         for hours, soaking and exhausted, before he had the strength to
         struggle home. Your father was no longer a young man. He was already
         in his fifties.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Fifty-six,&quot; Eddie said blankly.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Fifty-six,&quot; the old woman repeated. &quot;His body had been
         weakened, the ocean had left him vulnerable, pneu&shy;monia took hold
         of him, and in time, he died.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Because of Mickey?&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Because of loyalty,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;People don&#39;t die because of loyalty.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;They don&#39;t?&quot; She smiled. &quot;Religion? Government?
         Are we not loyal to such things, sometimes to the death?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie shrugged.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Better,&quot; she said, &quot;to be loyal to one another.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         AFTER THAT, THE two of them remained in the snowy mountain valley for
         a long time. At least to Eddie it felt long. He wasn&#39;t sure how
         long things took anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What happened to Mickey Shea?&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;He died, alone, a few years later,&quot; the old woman said.
         &quot;Drank his way to the grave. He never forgave himself for what
         happened.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;But my old man,&quot; Eddie said, rubbing his forehead. &quot;He
         never said anything.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;He never spoke of that night again, not to your mother, not to
         anyone else. He was ashamed for her, for Mickey, for himself. In the
         hospital, he stopped speaking altogether. Silence was his escape, but
         silence is rarely a refuge. His thoughts still haunted him.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;One night his breathing slowed and his eyes closed and he could
         not be awakened. The doctors said he had fallen into a coma.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie remembered that night. Another phone call to Mr. Nathanson.
         Another knock on his door.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;After that, your mother stayed by his bedside. Days and nights.
         She would moan to herself, softly, as if she were praying: &#39;I
         should have done something. I should have done something.&#39;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Finally, one night, at the doctors&#39; urging, she went home to
         sleep. Early the next morning, a nurse found your father slumped
         halfway out the window.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Wait,&quot; Eddie said. His eyes narrowed. &quot;The
         window?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Ruby nodded. &quot;Sometime during the night, your father awakened. He
         rose from his bed, staggered across the room, and found the strength
         to raise the window sash. He called your mother&#39;s name with what
         little voice he had, and he called yours, too, and your brother, Joe.
         And he called for Mickey. At that moment, it seemed, his heart was
         spilling out, all the guilt and regret. Perhaps he felt the light of
         death approaching. Perhaps he only knew you were all out there
         somewhere, in the streets beneath his window. He bent over the ledge.
         The night was chilly. The wind and damp, in his state, were too much.
         He was dead before dawn.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The nurses who found him dragged him back to his bed. They were
         frightened for their jobs, so they never breathed a word. The story
         was he died in his sleep.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie fell back, stunned. He thought about that final image. His
         father, the tough old war horse, trying to crawl out a window. Where
         was he going? What was he thinking? Which was worse when left
         unexplained: a life, or a death?
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         HOW DO YOU know all this?&quot; Eddie asked Ruby.
      </p>
      <p>
         She sighed. &quot;Your father lacked the money for a hos&shy;pital
         room of his own. So did the man on the other side of the
         curtain.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She paused.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Emile. My husband.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie lifted his eyes. His head moved back as if he&#39;d just solved
         a puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Then you <em>saw</em> my father.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yes.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;And my mother.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I heard her moaning on those lonely nights. We never spoke. But
         after your father&#39;s death, I inquired about your family. When I
         learned where he had worked, I felt a sting&shy;ing pain, as if I had
         lost a loved one myself. The pier that bore my name. I felt its cursed
         shadow, and I wished again that it had never been built.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;That wish followed me to heaven, even as I waited for you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked confused.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The diner?&quot; she said. She pointed to the speck of light in
         the mountains. &quot;It&#39;s there because I wanted to re&shy;turn to
         my younger years, a simple but secure life. And I wanted all those who
         had ever suffered at Ruby Pier&mdash;every accident, every fire, every
         fight, slip, and fall&mdash;to be safe and secure. I wanted them all
         like I wanted my Emile, warm, well fed, in the cradle of a welcoming
         place, far from the sea.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Ruby stood, and Eddie stood, too. He could not stop thinking about his
         father&#39;s death.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I hated him,&quot; he mumbled.
      </p>
      <p>
         The old woman nodded.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;He was hell on me as a kid. And he was worse when I got
         older.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Ruby stepped toward him. &quot;Edward,&quot; she said softly. It was
         the first time she had called him by name. &quot;Learn this from me.
         Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that
         hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred
         is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Forgive, Edward. Forgive. Do you remember the light&shy;ness you
         felt when you first arrived in heaven?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie did. <em>Where is my pain</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;That&#39;s because no one is born with anger. And when we die,
         the soul is freed of it. But now, here, in order to move on, you must
         understand why you felt what you did, and why you no longer need to
         feel it.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She touched his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You need to forgive your father.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         EDDIE THOUGHT ABOUT the years that followed his father&#39;s funeral.
         How he never achieved anything, how he never went anywhere. For all
         that time, Eddie had imagined a certain life&mdash;a &quot;could have
         been&quot; life&mdash;that would have been his if not for his
         father&#39;s death and his mother&#39;s subsequent collapse. Over the
         years, he glorified that imaginary life and held his father
         accountable for all of its losses: the loss of freedom, the loss of
         career, the loss of hope. He never rose above the dirty, tiresome work
         his father had left behind.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;When he died,&quot; Eddie said, &quot;he took part of me with
         him. I was stuck after that.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Ruby shook her head, &quot;Your father is not the reason you never
         left the pier.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie looked up. &quot;Then what is?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She patted her skirt. She adjusted her spectacles. She began to walk
         away. &quot;There are still two people for you to meet,&quot; she
         said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie tried to say &quot;Wait,&quot; but a cold wind nearly ripped the
         voice from his throat. Then everything went black.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         RUBY WAS GONE. He was back atop the mountain, outside the diner,
         standing in the snow.
      </p>
      <p>
         He stood there for a long time, alone in the silence, un&shy;til he
         realized the old woman was not coming back. Then he turned to the door
         and slowly pulled it open. He heard clanking silverware and dishes
         being stacked. He smelled freshly cooked food&mdash;breads and meats
         and sauces. The spirits of those who had perished at the pier were all
         around, engaged with one another, eating and drinking and talking.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie moved haltingly, knowing what he was there to do. He turned to
         his right, to the corner booth, to the ghost of his father, smoking a
         cigar. He felt a shiver. He thought about the old man hanging out that
         hospital win&shy;dow, dying alone in the middle of the night.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Dad?&quot; Eddie whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         His father could not hear him. Eddie drew closer. &quot;Dad. I know
         what happened now.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He felt a choke in his chest. He dropped to his knees alongside the
         booth. His father was so close that Eddie could see the whiskers on
         his face and the frayed end of his cigar. He saw the baggy lines
         beneath his tired eyes, the bent nose, the bony knuckles and squared
         shoulders of a workingman. He looked at his own arms and realized, in
         his earthly body, he was now older than his father. He had outlived
         him in every way.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I was angry with you, Dad. I hated you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie felt tears welling. He felt a shaking in his chest. Something
         was flushing out of him.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You beat me. You shut me out. I didn&#39;t understand. I still
         don&#39;t understand. Why did you do it? Why?&quot; He drew in long
         painful breaths. &quot;I didn&#39;t know, OK? I didn&#39;t know your
         life, what happened. I didn&#39;t <em>know</em> you. But you&#39;re my
         father. I&#39;ll let it go now, all right? All right? Can we let it
         go?
      </p>
      <p>
         His voice wobbled until it was high and wailing, not his own anymore.
         &quot;OK? YOU HEAR ME?&quot; he screamed. Then softer: &quot;You hear
         me? Dad?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He leaned in close. He saw his father&#39;s dirty hands. He spoke the
         last familiar words in a whisper.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s fixed.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie pounded the table, then slumped to the floor. When he looked up,
         he saw Ruby standing across the way, young and beautiful. She dipped
         her head, opened the door, and lifted off into the jade sky.

      <p>
         Who would pay for Eddie&#39;s funeral? He had no relatives. He&#39;d
         left no instructions. His body remained at the city morgue, as did his
         clothes and personal effects, his mainte&shy;nance shirt, his socks
         and shoes, his linen cap, his wedding ring, his cigarettes and pipe
         cleaners, all awaiting claim.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the end, Mr. Bullock, the park owner, footed the bill, using the
         money he saved from Eddie&#39;s no-longer-cashable paycheck. The
         casket was a wooden box. The church was chosen by location&mdash;the
         one nearest the pier&mdash;as most attendees had to get back to work.
      </p>
      <p>
         A few minutes before the service, the pastor asked Dominguez, wearing
         a navy blue sport coat and his good black jeans, to step inside his
         office.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Could you share some of the deceased&#39;s unique
         qualities?&quot; the pastor asked. &quot;I understand you worked with
         him.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Dominguez swallowed. He was none too comfortable with clergymen. He
         hooked his fingers together earnestly, as if giving the matter some
         thought, and spoke as softly as he thought one should speak in such a
         situation.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Eddie,&quot; he finally said, &quot;really loved his wife.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He unhooked his fingers, then quickly added, &quot;Of course, I never
         met her.&quot;

         The Fourth Person Eddie Meets in Heaven
      </h3>
      <p>
         EDDIE BLINKED, AND FOUND HIMSELF IN A small, round room. The mountains
         were gone and so was the jade sky. A low plaster ceiling just missed
         his head. The room was brown&mdash;as plain as shipping wrap&mdash;and
         empty, save for a wooden stool and an oval mirror on the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie stepped in front of the mirror. He cast no reflection. He saw
         only the reverse of the room, which expanded suddenly to include a row
         of doors. Eddie turned around.
      </p>
      <p>
         Then he coughed.
      </p>
      <p>
         The sound startled him, as if it came from someone else. He coughed
         again, a hard, rumbling cough, as if things needed to be resettled in
         his chest.
      </p>
      <p>
         When did <em>this</em> start? Eddie thought. He touched his skin,
         which had aged since his time with Ruby. It felt thinner now, and
         drier. His midsection, which during his time with the Captain had felt
         tight as pulled rubber, was loose with flab, the droop of age.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>There are still two people for you to meet</em>, Ruby had said.
         And then what? His lower back had a dull ache. His bad leg was growing
         stiffer. He realized what was happening, it hap&shy;pened with each
         new stage of heaven. He was rotting away.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         HE APPROACHED ONE of the doors and pushed it open. Suddenly, he was
         outside, in the yard of a home he had never seen, in a land that he
         did not recognize, in the midst of what appeared to be a wedding
         reception. Guests holding silver plates filled the grassy lawn. At one
         end stood an arch&shy;way covered in red flowers and birch branches,
         and at the other end, next to Eddie, stood the door that he had walked
         through. The bride, young and pretty, was in the center of the group,
         removing a pin from her butter-colored hair. The groom was lanky. He
         wore a black wedding coat and held up a sword, and at the hilt of the
         sword was a ring. He lowered it toward the bride and guests cheered as
         she took it. Eddie heard their voices, but the language was
         for&shy;eign. German? Swedish?
      </p>
      <p>
         He coughed again. The group looked up. Every person seemed to smile,
         and the smiling frightened Eddie. He backed quickly through the door
         from which he&#39;d entered, figuring to return to the round room.
         Instead, he was in the middle of another wedding, indoors this time,
         in a large hall, where the people looked Spanish and the bride wore
         orange blossoms in her hair. She was dancing from one partner to the
         next, and each guest handed her a small sack of coins.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie coughed again&mdash;he couldn&#39;t help it&mdash;and when
         several of the guests looked up, he backed through the door and again
         entered a different wedding scene, something African, Eddie guessed,
         where families poured wine onto the ground and the couple held hands
         and jumped over a broom. Then another pass through the door to a
         Chinese re&shy;ception, where firecrackers were lit before cheering
         attendees, then another doorway to something else&mdash;maybe
         French?&mdash; where the couple drank together from a two-handled cup.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>How long does this go on? Eddie</em> thought. In each reception,
         there were no signs of how the people had gotten there, no cars or
         buses, no wagons, no horses. Departure did not ap&shy;pear to be an
         issue. The guests milled about, and Eddie was absorbed as one of them,
         smiled at but never spoken to, much like the handful of weddings he
         had gone to on earth. He preferred it that way. Weddings were, in
         Eddie&#39;s mind, too full of embarrassing moments, like when couples
         were asked to join in a dance, or to help lift the bride in a chair.
         His bad leg seemed to glow at those moments, and he felt as if people
         could see it from across the room.
      </p>
      <p>
         Because of that, Eddie avoided most receptions, and when he did go, he
         often stood in the parking lot, smoking a cigarette, waiting for time
         to pass. For a long stretch, there were no weddings to attend, anyhow.
         Only in the late years of his life, when some of his teenaged pier
         workers had grown up and taken spouses, did he find himself
         get&shy;ting the faded suit out of the closet and putting on the
         col&shy;lared shirt that pinched his thick neck. By this point, his
         once-fractured leg bones were spurred and deformed. Arthritis had
         invaded his knee. He limped badly and was thus excused from all
         participatory moments, such as dances or candle lightings. He was
         considered an &quot;old man,&quot; alone, unattached, and no one
         expected him to do much besides smile when the photographer came to
         the table.
      </p>
      <p>
         Here, now, in his maintenance clothes, he moved from one wedding to
         the next, one reception to another, one lan&shy;guage, one cake, and
         one type of music to another language, another cake, and another type
         of music. The uniformity did not surprise Eddie. He always figured a
         wedding here was not much different from a wedding there. What he
         didn&#39;t get was what this had to do with <em>him</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
         He pushed through the threshold one more time and found himself in
         what appeared to be an Italian village. There were vineyards on the
         hillsides and farmhouses of travertine stone. Many of the men had
         thick, black hair, combed back and wet, and the women had dark eyes
         and sharp features. Eddie found a place against a wall and watched the
         bride and groom cut a log in half with a two-handed rip saw. Music
         played&mdash;flutists, violinists, guitarists&mdash; and guests began
         the tarantella, dancing in a wild, twirling rhythm. Eddie took a few
         steps back. His eyes wandered to the edge of the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
         A bridesmaid in a long lavender dress and a stitched straw hat moved
         through the guests, with a basket of candy-covered almonds. From afar,
         she looked to be in her 20s.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Per l&#39;amaro e il dolce</em>?&quot; she said, offering
         her sweets. &quot;<i>Per l</i><em>&#39;amaro e il dolce?... Per
         l&#39;amaro e il dolce</em>?...&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         At the sound of her voice, Eddie&#39;s whole body shook. He began to
         sweat. Something told him to run, but something else froze his feet to
         the ground. She came his way. Her eyes found him from beneath the hat
         brim, which was topped with parchment flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Per l&#39;amaro e il dolce</em>?&quot; she said, smiling,
         holding out the almonds. &quot;For the bitter and the sweet?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Her dark hair fell over one eye and Eddie&#39;s heart nearly burst.
         His lips took a moment to part, and the sound from the back of his
         throat took a moment to rise, but they came together in the first
         letter of the only name that ever made him feel this way. He dropped
         to his knees.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Marguerite . . .&quot; he whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;For the bitter and the sweet,&quot; she said.

         Today Is Eddie&#39;s Birthday
      </h3>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie and his brother are sitting in the maintenance shop.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;This,&quot; Joe says proudly, holding up a drill &quot;is
         the newest model.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Joe is wearing a checkered sport coat and black-and-white
         sad&shy;dle shoes. Eddie thinks his brother looks too fancy&mdash;and
         fancy means phony&mdash;but Joe is a salesman for a hardware company
         now and Ed&shy;die has been wearing the same outft for years, so what
         does he know?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Yes, sir, &quot;Joe says, &quot;and get this. It runs on
         that battery.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie holds the battery between his fingers, a small thing called
         nickel cadmium. Hard to believe.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Start it up, &quot;Joe says, handing the drill over.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie squeezes the trigger. It explodes in noise.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Nice, huh?&quot; Joe yells.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>That morning, Joe had told Eddie his new salary. It was three
         times what Eddie made. Then Joe had congratulated Eddie on his
         promotion: head of maintenance for Ruby Pier, his father&#39;s old
         posi&shy;tion. Eddie had wanted to answer, &quot;If it&#39;s so great,
         why don&#39;t</em> <em>you take it, and I&#39;ll take your job?&quot;
         But he didn&#39;t. Eddie never said any&shy;thing he felt that
         deeply</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Helloo? Anybody in here?&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Marguerite is at the door, holding a reel of orange tickets.
         Ed&shy;die&#39;s eyes go, as always, to her face, her olive skin, her
         dark coffee eyes. She has taken a job in the ticket booths this summer
         and she wears the official Ruby Pier uniform: a white shirt, a red
         vest, black stirrup pants, a red beret, and her name on a pin below
         her collarbone. The sight of it makes Eddie angry&mdash;especially in
         front of his hotshot brother.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Show her the drill, &quot;Joe says. He turns to Marguerite.
         &quot;Its battery operated.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie squeezes. Marguerite grabs her ears.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>It&#39;s louder than your snoring</em>,&quot; <em>she
         says</em>.

      <p>
         <em>&quot;Whoa-ho!&#39;Joe yells, laughing. &quot;Whoa-ho! She got

         <em>Eddie looks down sheepishly, then sees bis wife smiling.</em>

      <p>
         <em>&quot;Can you come outside?&quot; she says.</em>
      </p>

         <em>&quot;Just for a minute, OK?&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie stands up slowly, then follows her out the door. The sun
         hits his face.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;HAP-PY BIRTH-DAY, MR. ED-DIE!&quot; <em>a group of children
         scream in unison</em>.

         <em>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be,&quot; Eddie says.</em>

         cake!&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>The children race to a vanilla sheet cake sitting on a nearby
         folding table. Marguerite leans toward Eddie and whispers, &quot;I
         promised them you&#39;d blow out all thirty-eight at once.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie snorts. He watches his wife organize the group. As always
         with Marguerite and children, his mood is lified by her easy
         connec&shy;tion to them and dampened by her inability to bear them.
         One doc&shy;tor said she was too nervous. Another said she bad waited
         too long, she should have had them by age 25. In time, they ran out of
         money for doctors. It was what it was.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>For nearly a year now, she has been talking about adoption. She
         went to the library. She brought home papers. Eddie said they were too

      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s not you,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         She lowered her almond basket. She smiled sadly. The tarantella was
         dancing behind them and the sun was fading behind a ribbon of white
         clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s not you,&quot; Eddie said again.
      </p>
      <p>
         The dancers yelled, &quot;<em>Hooheyy</em>!&quot; They banged
         tambourines.
      </p>
      <p>
         She offered her hand. Eddie reached for it quickly, instinctively, as
         if grabbing for a falling object. Their fingers met and he had never
         felt such a sensation, as if flesh were forming over his own flesh,
         soft and warm and almost tick&shy;lish. She knelt down beside him.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s not you,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It <em>is</em> me,&quot; she whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Hooheyy!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s not you,&quot;
         Eddie mum&shy;bled, as he dropped his head onto her shoulder and, for
         the first time since his death, began to cry.

         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THEIR OWN WEDDING took place Christmas Eve on the second floor of a
         dimly lit Chinese restaurant called Sammy Hong&#39;s. The owner,
         Sammy, agreed to rent it for that night, figuring he&#39;d have little
         other business. Eddie took what cash he had left from the army and
         spent it on the reception&mdash;roast chicken and Chinese vegetables
         and port wine and a man with an accordion. The chairs for the ceremony
         were needed for the dinner, so once the vows were taken, the waiters
         asked the guests to rise, then carried the chairs downstairs to the
         tables. The accordion man sat on a stool. Years later, Marguerite
         would joke that the only thing missing from their wedding &quot;were
         the bingo cards.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         When the meal was finished and some small gifts were given, a final
         toast was offered and the accordion man packed his case. Eddie and
         Marguerite left through the front door. It was raining lightly, a
         chilly rain, but the bride and groom walked home together, seeing as
         it was only a few blocks. Marguerite wore her wedding dress beneath a
         thick pink sweater. Eddie wore his white suit coat, the shirt pinching
         his neck. They held hands. They moved through pools of lamplight.
         Everything around them seemed buttoned up tight.
      </p>

         <br>

      <p>
         PEOPLE SAY THEY &quot;find&quot; love, as if it were an object
         hid&shy;den by a rock. But love takes many forms, and it is never the
         same for any man and woman. What people find then is a
         <em>certain</em> love. And Eddie found a certain love with Marguerite,
         a grateful love, a deep but quiet love, one that he knew, above all
         else, was irreplaceable. Once she&#39;d gone, he&#39;d let the days go
         stale. He put his heart to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
         Now, here she was again, as young as the day they were wed. &quot;Walk
         with me,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie tried to stand, but his bad knee buckled. She lifted him
         effortlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Your leg,&quot; she said, regarding the faded scar with a tender
         familiarity. Then she looked up and touched the tufts of hair above
         his ears.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It&#39;s white,&quot; she said, smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie couldn&#39;t get his tongue to move. He couldn&#39;t do much but
         stare. She was exactly as he remembered&mdash;more beautiful, really,
         for his final memories of her had been as an older, suffering woman.
         He stood beside her, silent, until her dark eyes narrowed and her lips
         crept up mischievously.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Eddie.&quot; She almost giggled. &quot;Have you forgotten so
         fast how I used to look?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie swallowed. &quot;I never forgot that.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She touched his face lightly and the warmth spread through his body.
         She motioned to the village and the dancing guests.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;All weddings,&quot; she said, happily. &quot;That was my choice.
         A world of weddings, behind every door. Oh, Eddie, it never changes,
         when the groom lifts the veil, when the bride accepts the ring, the
         possibilities you see in their eyes, it&#39;s the same around the
         world. They truly believe their love and their marriage is going to
         break all the records.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She smiled. &quot;Do you think we had that?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie didn&#39;t know how to answer.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;We had an accordion player,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THEY WALKED FROM the reception and up a gravel path. The music faded
         to a background noise. Eddie wanted to tell her everything he had
         seen, everything that had hap&shy;pened. He wanted to ask her about
         every little thing and every big thing, too. He felt a churning inside
         him, a stop-start anxiety. He had no idea where to begin.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You did this, too?&quot; he finally said. &quot;You met five
         people?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She nodded.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;A different five people,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         She nodded again.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;And they explained everything? And it made a difference?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She smiled. &quot;All the difference.&quot; She touched his chin.
         &quot;And then I waited for you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He studied her eyes. Her smile. He wondered if her waiting had felt
         like his.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;How much do you know . . . about me? I mean, how much do you
         know since ...&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He still had trouble saying it.

      <h3>
         Today Is Eddie&#39;s Birthday
      </h3>
      <p>
         <em>The racetrack is crowded with summer customers. The women wear
         straw sunhats and the men smoke cigars. Eddie and Noel leave work
         early to play Eddie&#39;s birthday number, 39, in the Daily Double.
         They sit on slatted fold-down seats. At their feet are paper cups of
         beer, amidst a carpet of discarded tickets.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Earlier, Eddie won the first race of the day. He&#39;d put half of
         those winnings on the second race and won that as well, the first time
         such a thing had ever happened to him. That gave him $209. After
         losing twice in smaller bets, he put it all on a horse to win in the
         sixth, because, as he and Noel agreed, in exuberant logic, he&#39;d
         arrived with next to nothing, so what harm done if he went home the
         same way?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Just think, if you win,&quot; Noel says now,
         <sup>u</sup>you&#39;ll have all that dough for the kid.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>The bell rings. The horses are off. They bunch together on the far
         straightaway, their colorful silks blurring with their bumpy
         move&shy;ment. Eddie has No. 8, a horse named Jersey Finch, which
         isn&#39;t a bad gamble, not at four to one, but what Noel has just
         said about &quot;the kid&quot;&mdash;the one Eddie and Marguerite are
         planning to adopt&mdash; flushes him with guilt. They could have used
         that money. Why did he do things like this?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>The crowd rises. The horses come down the stretch. Jersey Finch
         moves outside and lengthens into full stride. The cheering mixes with
         the thundering hooves. Noel hollers. Eddie squeezes his ticket. He is
         more nervous than he wants to be. His skin goes bumpy. One horse pulls
         ahead of the pack.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Jersey Finch!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Now Eddie has nearly $800.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;I gotta call home,&quot; he says.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;You&#39;ll ruin it, &quot;Noel says.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;You tell somebody, you ruin your luck.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;You&#39;re nuts.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Don&#39;t do it.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;I&#39;m calling her. It&#39;ll make her happy.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;It won&#39;t make her happy.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>He limps to a pay phone and drops in a nickel. Marguerite
         an&shy;swers. Eddie tells her the news. Noel is right. She is not
         happy. She tells him to come home. He tells her to stop telling him
         what to do.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;We have a baby coming,&quot; she scolds. &quot;You can&#39;t
         keep behav&shy;ing like this.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Eddie hangs up the phone with a heat behind his ears. He goes back
         to Noel, who is eating peanuts at the railing.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Let me guess, &quot;Noel says.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>They go to the window and pick another horse. Eddie takes the
         money from his pocket. Half of him doesn&#39;t want it anymore and
         half of him wants twice as much, so he can throw it on the bed when he
         gets home and tell his wife, &quot;Here, buy whatever you want,
         OK?&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Noel watches him push the bills through the opening. He raises his
         eyebrows.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>I know, I know</em>,&quot; <em>Eddie says</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>What he does not know is that Marguerite, unable to call him back,
         has chosen to drive to the track and find him. She feels badly about
         yelling, this being his birthday, and she wants to apologize; she also
         wants him to stop. She knows from evenings past that Noel will insist
         they stay until closing&mdash;Noel is like that. And since the track
         is only ten minutes away, she grabs her handbag and drives their
         secondhand Nash Rambler down Ocean Parkway. She turns right on Lester
         Street. The sun is gone and the sky is influx. Most of the cars are
         coming from the other direction. She approaches the Lester Street
         overpass, which used to be how customers reached the track, up the
         stairs, over the street and back down the stairs again, until the
         track owners paid the city for a traffic light, which left the
         overpass, for the most part, deserted.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>But on this night, it is not deserted. It holds two teenagers who
         do not want to be found, two 17-year-olds who, hours earlier, had been
         chased from a liquor store after stealing five cartons of cigarettes
         and three pints of Old Harper&#39;s whiskey. Now, having finished the
         alcohol and smoked many of the cigarettes, they are bored with the
         evening, and they dangle their empty bottles over the lip of the
         rusted railing.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;Dare me?&quot; one says.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Dare ya</em>,&quot; <em>says the other</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>The first one lets the bottle drop and they duck behind the metal
         grate to watch. It just misses a car and shatters onto the
         pavement.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Whoooo</em>,&quot; <em>the second one yells. &quot;Did you
         see that</em>!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Drop yours now, chicken</em>.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>The second one stands, holds out his bottle, and chooses the
         sparse traffic of the right-hand lane. He wiggles the bottle back and
         forth, trying to time the drop to land between vehicles, as if this
         was some sort of art and he was some sort of artist.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>His fingers release. He almost smiles.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Forty feet below, Marguerite never thinks to look up, never thinks
         that anything might be happening on that overpass, never thinks about
         anything besides getting Eddie out of that racetrack while he still
         has some money left. She is wondering what section of the grandstand
         to look in, even as the Old Harper&#39;s whiskey bottle smashes her
         windshield into a spray of flying glass. Her car veers into the
         concrete divider. Her body is tossed like a doll slamming against the
         door and the dashboard and the steering wheel, lacerating her liver
         and breaking her arm and thumping her head so hard she loses touch
         with the sounds of the evening. She does not hear the screeching of
         cars. She does not hear the honking of horns. She does not hear the
         retreat of rubber-soled sneakers, running down the Lester Street
         overpass and off into the night.</em>

         LOVE, LIKE RAIN, can nourish from above, drench&shy;ing couples with a
         soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries
         on the surface and must nour&shy;ish from below, tending to its roots,
         keeping itself alive.
      </p>
      <p>
         The accident on Lester Street sent Marguerite to the hospital. She was
         confined to bed rest for nearly six months. Her injured liver
         recovered eventually, but the expense and the delay cost them the
         adoption. The child they were ex&shy;pecting went to someone else. The
         unspoken blame for this never found a resting place&mdash;it simply
         moved like a shadow from husband to wife. Marguerite went quiet for a
         long time. Eddie lost himself in work. The shadow took a place at
         their table and they ate in its presence, amid the lonely clanking of
         forks and plates. When they spoke, they spoke of small things. The
         water of their love was hidden beneath the roots. Eddie never bet the
         horses again. His visits with Noel came to a gradual end, each of them
         unable to discuss much over breakfast that didn&#39;t feel like an
         effort.
      </p>
      <p>
         An amusement park in California introduced the first tubular steel
         tracks&mdash;they twisted at severe angles unachiev&shy;able with
         wood&mdash;and suddenly, roller coasters, which had faded to near
         oblivion, were back in fashion. Mr. Bullock, the park owner, had
         ordered a steel-track model for Ruby Pier, and Eddie oversaw the
         construction. He barked at the installers, checking their every move.
         He didn&#39;t trust any&shy;thing this fast. Sixty-degree angles? He
         was sure someone would get hurt. Anyhow, it gave him a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Stardust Band Shell was torn down. So was the Zipper ride. And the
         Tunnel of Love, which kids found too corny now. A few years later, a
         new boat ride called a log flume was constructed, and, to Eddie&#39;s
         surprise, it was hugely popular. The riders floated through troughs of
         water and dropped, at the end, into a large splash pool. Eddie
         couldn&#39;t figure why people so loved getting wet, when the ocean
         was 300 yards away. But he maintained it just the same, working
         shoeless in the water, ensuring that the boats never loosened from the
         tracks.
      </p>
      <p>
         In time, husband and wife began talking again, and one night, Eddie
         even spoke about adopting. Marguerite rubbed her forehead and said,
         &quot;We&#39;re too old now.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie said, &quot;What&#39;s too old to a child?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The years passed. And while a child never came, their wound slowly
         healed, and their companionship rose to fill the space they were
         saving for another. In the mornings, she made him toast and coffee,
         and he dropped her at her cleaning job then drove back to the pier.
         Sometimes, in the afternoons, she got off early and walked the
         boardwalk with him, following his rounds, riding carousel horses or
         yellow-painted clamshells as Eddie explained the rotors and cables and
         listened for the engines&#39; hum.
      </p>
      <p>
         One July evening, they found themselves walking by the ocean, eating
         grape popsicles, their bare feet sinking in the wet sand. They looked
         around and realized they were the oldest people on the beach.
      </p>
      <p>
         Marguerite said something about the bikini bathing suits the young
         girls were wearing and how she would never have the nerve to wear such
         a thing. Eddie said the girls were lucky, because if she did the men
         would not look at anyone else. And even though by this point
         Marguerite was in her mid-40s and her hips had thickened and a web of
         small lines had formed around her eyes, she thanked Eddie gratefully
         and looked at his crooked nose and wide jaw. The waters of their love
         fell again from above and soaked them as surely as the sea that
         gathered at their feet.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         THREE YEARS LATER, she was breading chicken cutlets in the kitchen of
         their apartment, the one they had kept all this time, long after
         Eddie&#39;s mother had died, because Mar&shy;guerite said it reminded
         her of when they were kids, and she liked to see the old carousel out
         the window. Suddenly, with&shy;out warning, the fingers of her right
         hand stretched open un&shy;controllably. They moved backward. They
         would not close. The cutlet slid from her palm. It fell into the sink.
         Her arm throbbed. Her breathing quickened. She stared for a
         mo&shy;ment at this hand with the locked fingers that appeared to
         be&shy;long to someone else, someone gripping a large, invisible jar.
         Then everything went dizzy.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Eddie?&quot; she called, but by the time he arrived, she had
         passed out on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         IT WAS, THEY would determine, a tumor on the brain, and her decline
         would be like many others, treatments that made the disease seem mild,
         hair falling out in patches, mornings spent with noisy radiation
         machines and evenings spent vomiting in a hospital toilet.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the final days, when cancer was ruled the victor, the doctors said
         only, &quot;Rest. Take it easy.&quot; When she asked ques&shy;tions,
         they nodded sympathetically, as if their nods were med&shy;icine doled
         out with a dropper. She realized this was protocol, their way of being
         nice while being helpless, and when one of them suggested
         &quot;getting your affairs in order,&quot; she asked to be released
         from the hospital. She told more than asked.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie helped her up the stairs and hung her coat as she looked around
         the apartment. She wanted to cook but he made her sit, and he heated
         some water for tea. He had pur&shy;chased lamb chops the day before,
         and that night he bum&shy;bled through a dinner with several invited
         friends and coworkers, most of whom greeted Marguerite and her sallow
         complexion with sentences like, &quot;Well, look who&#39;s back!&quot;
         as if this were a homecoming and not a farewell party.
      </p>
      <p>
         They ate mashed potatoes from a CorningWare dish and had butterscotch
         brownies for dessert, and when Marguerite finished a second glass of
         wine, Eddie took the bottle and poured her a third.
      </p>
      <p>
         Two days later, she awoke with a scream. He drove her to the hospital
         in the predawn silence. They spoke in short sentences, what doctor
         might be on, who Eddie should call. And even though she was sitting in
         the seat next to him, Eddie felt her in everything, in the steering
         wheel, in the gas pedal, in the blinking of his eye, in the clearing
         of his throat. Every move he made was about hanging on to her.
      </p>
      <p>
         She was 47.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You have the card?&quot; she asked him.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The card . . .&quot; he said blankly.
      </p>
      <p>
         She drew a deep breath and closed her eyes, and her voice was thinner
         when she resumed speaking, as if that breath had cost her dearly.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Insurance,&quot; she croaked.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; he said quickly. &quot;I got the card.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         They parked in the lot and Eddie shut the engine. It was suddenly too
         still and too quiet. He heard every tiny sound, the squeak of his body
         on the leather seat, the <em>ca-cunk</em> of the door handle, the rush
         of outside air, his feet on the pavement, the jangle of his keys.
      </p>
      <p>
         He opened her door and helped her get out. Her shoulders were
         scrunched up near her jaws, like a freezing child. Her hair blew
         across her face. She sniffed and lifted her eyes to the horizon. She
         motioned to Eddie and nodded toward the distant top of a big, white
         amusement ride, with red carts dangling like tree ornaments.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You can see it from here,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The Ferris wheel?&quot; he said. She looked away.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Home.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         BECAUSE HE HAD not slept in heaven, it was Eddie&#39;s perception that
         he had not spent more than a few hours with any of the people he&#39;d
         met. Then again, without night or day, without sleeping or waking,
         without sunsets or high tides or meals or schedules, how did he know?
      </p>
      <p>
         With Marguerite, he wanted only time&mdash;more and more
         time&mdash;and he was granted it, nighttimes and daytimes and
         nighttimes again. They walked through the doors of the as&shy;sorted
         weddings and spoke of everything he wished to speak about. At a
         Swedish ceremony, Eddie told her about his brother, Joe, who had died
         10 years earlier from a heart at&shy;tack, just a month after
         purchasing a new condominium in Florida. At a Russian ceremony, she
         asked if he had kept the old apartment, and he said that he had, and
         she said she was glad. At an outdoor ceremony in a Lebanese village,
         he spoke about what had happened to him here in heaven, and she seemed
         to listen and know at the same time. He spoke of the Blue Man and his
         story, why some die when others live, and he spoke about the Captain
         and his tale of sacri&shy;fice. When he spoke about his father,
         Marguerite recalled the many nights he had spent enraged at the man,
         con&shy;founded by his silence. Eddie told her he had made things
         square, and her eyebrows lifted and her lips spread and Ed&shy;die
         felt an old, warm feeling he had missed for years, the simple act of
         making his wife happy.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         ONE NIGHT, EDDIE spoke about the changes at Ruby Pier, how the old
         rides had been torn down, how the pennywhistle music at the arcade was
         now blaring rock &#39;n&#39; roll, how the roller coasters now had
         corkscrew twists and carts that hung <em>down</em> from the tracks,
         how the &quot;dark&quot; rides, which once meant cowboy cutouts in
         glow paint, were full of video screens now, like watching television
         all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
         He told her the new names. No more Dippers or Tum&shy;ble Bugs.
         Everything was the Blizzard, the Mindbender, Top Gun, the Vortex.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Sounds strange, don&#39;t it?&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;It sounds,&quot; she said, wistfully, &quot;like someone
         else&#39;s summer.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie realized that was precisely what he&#39;d been feeling for
         years.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I should have worked somewhere else,&quot; he told her.
         &quot;I&#39;m sorry I never got us out of there. My dad. My leg. I
         always felt like such a bum after the war.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He saw a sadness pass over her face.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What happened?&quot; she asked. &quot;During that war?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He had never quite told her. It was all understood. Soldiers, in his
         day, did what they had to do and didn&#39;t speak of it once they came
         home. He thought about the men he&#39;d killed. He thought about the
         guards. He thought about the blood on his hands. He wondered if
         he&#39;d ever be forgiven.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I lost myself,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No,&quot; his wife said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yes,&quot; he whispered, and she said nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         AT TIMES, THERE in heaven, the two of them would lie down together.
         But they did not sleep. On earth, Marguerite said, when you fell
         asleep, you sometimes dreamed your heaven and those dreams helped to
         form it. But there was no reason for such dreams now.
      </p>
      <p>
         Instead, Eddie held her shoulders and nuzzled in her hair and took
         long, deep breaths. At one point, he asked his wife if God knew he was
         here. She smiled and said, &#39;&#39;Of course,&quot; even when Eddie
         admitted that some of his life he&#39;d spent hiding from God, and the
         rest of the time he thought he went unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>
         The Fourth Lesson
      </h3>
      <p>
         FINALLY, AFTER MANY TALKS, Marguerite walked Eddie through another
         door. They were back inside the small, round room. She sat on the
         stool and placed her fingers to&shy;gether. She turned to the mirror,
         and Eddie noticed her re&shy;flection. Hers, but not his.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The bride waits here,&quot; she said, running her hands along
         her hair, taking in her image but seeming to drift away. &quot;This is
         the moment you think about what you&#39;re doing. Who you&#39;re
         choosing. Who you will love. If it&#39;s right, Eddie, this can be
         such a wonderful moment.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She turned to him.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You had to live without love for many years, didn&#39;t
         you?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie said nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You felt that it was snatched away, that I left you too
         soon.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He lowered himself slowly. Her lavender dress was spread before him.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You <em>did leave</em> too soon,&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You were angry with me.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;No.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Her eyes flashed.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;OK. Yes.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;There was a reason to it all,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What reason?&quot; he said. &quot;How could there be a
         rea&shy;son? You died. You were forty-seven. You were the best
         per&shy;son any of us knew, and you died and you lost everything. And
         I lost everything. I lost the only woman I ever loved.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She took his hands. &quot;No, you didn&#39;t. I was right here. And
         you loved me anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Lost love is still love, Eddie. It takes a different form,
         that&#39;s all. You can&#39;t see their smile or bring them food or
         tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those
         senses weaken, another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner.
         You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Life has to end,&quot; she said. &quot;Love doesn&#39;t.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie thought about the years after he buried his wife. It was like
         looking over a fence. He was aware of another kind of life out there,
         even as he knew he would never be a part of it. &quot;I never wanted
         anyone else,&quot; he said quietly.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I know,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I was still in love with you.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I know.&quot; She nodded. &quot;I felt it.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Here?&quot; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Even here,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;That&#39;s how strong
         lost love can be.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She stood and opened a door, and Eddie blinked as he entered behind
         her. It was a dimly lit room, with foldable chairs, and an accordion
         player sitting in the corner.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I was saving this one,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         She held out her arms. And for the first time in heaven, he initiated
         his contact, he came to her, ignoring the leg, ig&shy;noring all the
         ugly associations he had made about dance and music and weddings,
         realizing now that they were really about loneliness.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;All that&#39;s missing,&quot; Marguerite whispered, taking his
         shoulder, &quot;is the bingo cards.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He grinned and put a hand behind her waist.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Can I ask you something?&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yes.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;How come you look the way you looked the day I mar&shy;ried
         you?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I thought you&#39;d like it that way.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He thought for a moment. &quot;Can you change it?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Change it?&quot; She looked amused. &quot;To what?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;To the end.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She lowered her arms. &quot;I wasn&#39;t so pretty at the end.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie shook his head, as if to say not true.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Could you?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She took a moment, then came again into his arms. The accordion man
         played the familiar notes. She hummed in his ear and they began to
         move together, slowly, in a remembered rhythm that a husband shares
         only with his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>You made me love you</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>I didn &#39;t want to do it</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>I didn&#39;t want to do it....</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>You made me love you</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>and all the time you knew it</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>and all the time you knew it....</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         When he moved his head back, she was 47 again, the web of lines beside
         her eyes, the thinner hair, the looser skin be&shy;neath her chin. She
         smiled and he smiled, and she was, to him, as beautiful as ever, and
         he closed his eyes and said for the first time what he&#39;d been
         feeling from the moment he saw her again: &quot;I don&#39;t want to go
         on. I want to stay here.&quot; When he opened his eyes, his arms still
         held her shape, but she was gone, and so was everything else.

         <br>
         <br>
      </h3>
      <p>
         <b>Friday, 3:15 P.M.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         Dominguez pressed the elevator button and the door rum&shy;bled
         closed. An inner porthole lined up with an exterior porthole. The car
         jerked upward, and through the meshed glass he watched the lobby
         disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I can&#39;t believe this elevator still works,&quot; Dominguez
         said. &quot;It must be, like, from the last century.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The man beside him, an estate attorney, nodded slightly, feigning
         interest. He took off his hat&mdash;it was stuffy, and he was
         sweating&mdash;and watched the numbers light up on the brass panel.
         This was his third appointment of the day. One more, and he could go
         home to dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Eddie didn&#39;t have much,&quot; Dominguez said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Um-hmm,&quot; the man said, wiping his forehead with a
         handkerchief. &quot;Then it shouldn&#39;t take long.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         The elevator bounced to a stop and the door rumbled open and they
         turned toward 6B. The hallway still had the black-and-white checkered
         tile of the 1960s, and it smelled of someone&#39;s
         cooking&mdash;garlic and fried potatoes. The superin&shy;tendent had
         given them the key&mdash;along with a deadline, Next Wednesday. Have
         the place cleared out for a new tenant.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Wow . . .&quot; Dominguez said, upon opening the door and
         entering the kitchen. &quot;Pretty tidy for an old guy.&quot; The sink
         was clean. The counters were wiped. Lord knows, he thought,
         <em>his</em> place was never this neat.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Financial papers?&quot; the man asked. &quot;Bank statements?
         Jewelry?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Dominguez thought of Eddie wearing jewelry and he almost laughed. He
         realized how much he missed the old man, how strange it was not having
         him at the pier, barking orders, watching everything like a mother
         hawk. They hadn&#39;t even cleared out his locker. No one had the
         heart. They just left his stuff at the shop, where it was, as if he
         were coming back tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I dunno. You check in that bedroom thing?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &#39;&#39;The bureau?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Yeah. You know, I only been here once myself. I really only knew
         Eddie through work.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Dominguez leaned over the table and glanced out the kitchen window. He
         saw the old carousel. He looked at his watch. <em>Speaking of
         work</em>, he thought to himself.
      </p>
      <p>
         The attorney opened the top drawer of the bedroom bureau. He pushed
         aside the pairs of socks, neatly rolled, one inside the other, and the
         underwear, white boxer shorts, stacked by the waistbands. Tucked
         beneath them was an old leather-bound box, a serious-looking thing. He
         flipped it open in hopes of a quick find. He frowned. Nothing
         important. No bank statements. No insurance policies. Just a black bow
         tie, a Chinese restaurant menu, an old deck of cards, a letter with an
         army medal, and a faded Polaroid of a man by a birthday cake,
         surrounded by children.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Hey,&quot; Dominguez called from the other room, &quot;is this
         what you need?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         He emerged with a stack of envelopes taken from a kitchen drawer, some
         from a local bank, some from the Vet&shy;erans Administration. The
         attorney fingered through them and, without looking up, said,
         &quot;That&#39;ll do.&quot; He pulled out one bank statement and made
         a mental note of the balance. Then, as often happened with these
         visits, he silently con&shy;gratulated himself on his own portfolio of
         stocks, bonds, and a vested retirement plan. It sure beat ending up
         like this poor slob, with little to show but a tidy kitchen.

      <h3>
         The Fifth Person Eddie Meets in Heaven
      </h3>
      <p>
         <em>WHITE</em>. THERE WAS ONLY WHITE NOW. NO earth, no sky, no horizon
         between the two. Only a pure and silent white, as noiseless as the
         deepest snowfall at the quietest sunrise.
      </p>
      <p>
         White was all Eddie saw. All he heard was his own labored breathing,
         followed by an echo of that breathing. He inhaled and heard a louder
         inhale. He exhaled, and it ex&shy;haled, too.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie squeezed his eyes shut. Silence is worse when you know it
         won&#39;t be broken, and Eddie knew. His wife was gone. He wanted her
         desperately, one more minute, half a minute, five more seconds, but
         there was no way to reach or call or wave or even look at her picture.
         He felt as if he&#39;d tumbled down steps and was crumpled at the
         bottom. His soul was vacant. He had no impulse. He hung limp and
         lifeless in the void, as if on a hook, as if all the flu&shy;ids had
         been gored out of him. He might have hung there a day or a month. It
         might have been a century.
      </p>
      <p>
         Only at the arrival of a small but haunting noise did he stir, his
         eyelids lifting heavily. He had already been to four pockets of
         heaven, met four people, and while each had been mystifying upon
         arrival, he sensed that this was some&shy;thing altogether different.
      </p>
      <p>
         The tremor of noise came again, louder now, and Ed&shy;die, in a
         lifelong defense instinct, clenched his fists, only to find his right
         hand squeezing a cane. His forearms were pocked with liver spots. His
         fingernails were small and yel&shy;lowish. His bare legs carried the
         reddish rash&mdash;shingles&mdash; that had come during his final
         weeks on earth. He looked away from his hastening decay. In human
         accounting, his body was near its end.
      </p>
      <p>
         Now came the sound again, a high-pitched rolling of irregular shrieks
         and lulls. In life, Eddie had heard this sound in his nightmares, and
         he shuddered with the memory: the village, the fire, Smitty and this
         noise, this squealing cackle that, in the end, emerged from his own
         throat when he tried to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
         He clenched his teeth, as if that might make it stop, but it continued
         on, like an unheeded alarm, until Eddie yelled into the choking
         whiteness: &quot;What is it? <em>What do you want</em>?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         With that, the high-pitched noise moved to the background, layered
         atop a second noise, a loose, relentless rumble&mdash;the sound of a
         running river&mdash;and the whiteness shrank to a sun spot reflecting
         off shimmering waters. Ground appeared beneath Eddie&#39;s feet. His
         cane touched something solid. He was high up on an embankment, where a
         breeze blew across his face and a mist brought his skin to a moist
         glaze. He looked down and saw, in the river, the source of those
         haunting screeches, and he was flushed with the relief of a man who
         finds, while gripping the baseball bat, that there is no intruder in
         his house. The sound, this screaming, whistling, thrumming screak, was
         merely the ca&shy;cophony of children&#39;s voices, thousands of them
         at play, splashing in the river and shrieking with innocent laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>Was this what I&#39;d been dreaming</em>? he thought. <em>All this
         time? Why</em>? He studied the small bodies, some jumping, some
         wading, some carrying buckets while others rolled in the high grass.
         He noticed a certain calmness to it all, no rough-housing, which you
         usually saw with kids. He noticed some&shy;thing else. There were no
         adults. Not even teenagers. These were all small children, with skin
         the color of dark wood, seemingly monitoring themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
         And then Eddie&#39;s eyes were drawn to a white boulder. A slender
         young girl stood upon it, apart from the others, facing his direction.
         She motioned with both her hands, waving him in. He hesitated. She
         smiled. She waved again and nodded, as if to say, <em>Yes, you</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie lowered his cane to navigate the downward slope. He slipped, his
         bad knee buckling, his legs giving way. But before he hit the earth,
         he felt a sudden blast of wind at his back and he was whipped forward
         and straightened on his feet, and there he was, standing before the
         little girl as if he&#39;d been there all the time.

      </h3>
      <p>
         <em>He is 51. A Saturday. It is his first birthday without Marguerite.
         He makes Sanka in a paper cup, and eats two pieces of toast with
         margarine. In the years after his wife&#39;s accident, Eddie shooed
         away any birthday celebrations, saying, &quot;Why do I gotta be
         reminded of that day for?&quot; It was Marguerite who insisted. She
         made the cake. She invited friends. She always purchased one bag of
         taffy and tied it with a ribbon. &quot;You can&#39;t give away your
         birth&shy;day,&quot; she would say.</em>

      <p>
         <em>Now that she&#39;s gone, Eddie tries. At work, he straps himself
         on a roller coaster curve, high and alone, like a mountain climber. At
         night, he watches television in the apartment. He goes to bed early.
         No cake. No guests. It is never hard to act ordinary if you feel
         ordi&shy;nary, and the paleness of surrender becomes the color of
         Eddies days.</em>

         <em>He is 60, a Wednesday. He gets to the shop early. He opens a

      <h3>
         The Last Lesson
      </h3>
      <p>
         THE LITTLE GIRL APPEARED TO BE ASIAN, maybe five or six years old,
         with a beautiful cinnamon complexion, hair the color of a dark plum, a
         small flat nose, full lips that spread joyfully over her gapped teeth,
         and the most arresting eyes, as black as a seal&#39;s hide, with a
         pinhead of white serving as a pupil. She smiled and flapped her hands
         excitedly until Ed&shy;die edged one step closer, whereupon she
         presented herself.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Tala,&quot; she said, offering her name, her palms on her chest.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Tala,&quot; Eddie repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
         She smiled as if a game had begun. She pointed to her embroidered
         blouse, loosely slung over her shoulders and wet with the river water.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Baro</em>,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Baro.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She touched the woven red fabric that wrapped around her torso and
         legs. &quot;S<em>aya.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>&quot;S</em>aya.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Then came her cloglike
         shoes&mdash;&quot;<em>bakya&quot;&mdash;</em>then the iridescent
         seashells by her feet&mdash;&quot;<em>capiz&quot;&mdash;</em>then a
         woven bamboo mat&mdash;&quot;<em>banig&quot;&mdash;</em>that was laid
         out before her. She motioned for Eddie to sit on the mat and she sat,
         too, her legs curled underneath her.
      </p>
      <p>
         None of the other children seemed to notice him. They splashed and
         rolled and collected stones from the river&#39;s floor. Eddie watched
         one boy rub a stone over the body of another, down his back, under his
         arms.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Washing,&quot; the girl said. &quot;Like our <em>inas</em> used
         to do.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Inas?&quot; Eddie said.
      </p>
      <p>
         She studied Eddie&#39;s face.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Mommies,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie had heard many children in his life, but in this one&#39;s
         voice, he detected none of the normal hesitation toward adults. He
         wondered if she and the other children had chosen this riverbank
         heaven, or if, given their short mem&shy;ories, such a serene
         landscape had been chosen for them.
      </p>
      <p>
         She pointed to Eddie&#39;s shirt pocket. He looked down. Pipe
         cleaners.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;These?&quot; he said. He pulled them out and twisted them
         together, as he had done in his days at the pier. She rose to her
         knees to examine the process. His hands shook. &#39;&#39;You see?
         It&#39;s a ...&quot; he finished the last twist &quot;. . . dog.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She took it and smiled&mdash;a smile Eddie had seen a thousand times.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You like that?&quot; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You burn me,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         EDDIE FELT HIS jaw tighten.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What did you say?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You burn me. You make me fire.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Her voice was flat, like a child reciting a lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;My ina say to wait inside the <em>nipa</em>. My ina say to
         hide.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie lowered his voice, his words slow and deliberate.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;What. . . were you hiding <em>from</em>, little girl?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She fingered the pipe-cleaner dog, then dipped it in the water.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;<em>Sundalong&quot;</em> she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Sundalong?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She looked up.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Soldier.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie felt the word like a knife in his tongue. Images flashed through
         his head. Soldiers. Explosions. Morton. Smitty. The Captain. The
         flamethrowers.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Tala . . .&quot; he whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Tala,&quot; she said, smiling at her own name.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Why are you here, in heaven?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She lowered the animal.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You burn me. You make me fire.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie felt a pounding behind his eyes. His head began to rush. His
         breathing quickened.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You were in the Philippines . .. the shadow ... in that hut. .
         .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The <em>nipa</em>. Ina say be safe there. Wait for her. Be safe.
         Then big noise. Big fire. You burn me.&quot; She shrugged her narrow
         shoulders. &quot;Not safe.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie swallowed. His hands trembled. He looked into her deep, black
         eyes and he tried to smile, as if it were a medicine the little girl
         needed. She smiled back, but this only made him fall apart. His face
         collapsed, and he buried it in his palms. His shoulders and lungs gave
         way. The dark&shy;ness that had shadowed him all those years was
         revealing it&shy;self at last, it was real, flesh and blood, this
         child, this lovely child, he had killed her, burned her to death, the
         bad dreams he&#39;d suffered, he&#39;d deserved every one. He
         <em>had</em> seen something! That shadow in the flame! Death by his
         hand! <em>By his own fiery hand</em>! A flood of tears soaked through
         his fin&shy;gers and his soul seemed to plummet.
      </p>
      <p>
         He wailed then, and a howl rose within him in a voice he had never
         heard before, a howl from the very belly of his being, a howl that
         rumbled the river water and shook the misty air of heaven. His body
         convulsed, and his head jerked wildly, until the howling gave way to
         prayerlike utter&shy;ances, every word expelled in the breathless
         surge of confes&shy;sion: &quot;I killed you, I KILLED YOU,&quot; then
         a whispered &quot;forgive me,&quot; then, &quot;FORGIVE ME, OH, GOD
         ...&quot; and finally, &quot;What have I done ... <em>WHAT HAVE I
         DONE</em>?...&quot; He wept and he wept, until the weeping drained him
         to a shiver. Then he shook silently, swaying back and forth. He was
         kneeling on a mat before the little dark-haired girl, who played with
         her pipe-cleaner animal along the bank of the flowing river.
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         AT SOME POINT, when his anguish had quieted, Eddie felt a tapping on
         his shoulder. He looked up to see Tala holding out a stone.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You wash me,&quot; she said. She stepped into the water and
         turned her back to Eddie. Then she pulled the embroidered baro over
         her head.
      </p>
      <p>
         He recoiled. Her skin was horribly burned. Her torso and narrow
         shoulders were black and charred and blistered. When she turned
         around, the beautiful, innocent face was covered in grotesque scars.
         Her lips drooped. Only one eye was open. Her hair was gone in patches
         of burned scalp, covered now by hard, mottled scabs.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;You wash me,&quot; she said again, holding out the stone.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie dragged himself into the river. He took the stone. His fingers
         trembled.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I don&#39;t know how....&quot; he mumbled, barely audible.
         &quot;I never had children....&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She raised her charred hand and Eddie gripped it gently and slowly
         rubbed the stone along her forearm, until the scars began to loosen.
         He rubbed harder; they peeled away. He quickened his efforts until the
         singed flesh fell and the healthy flesh was visible. Then he turned
         the stone over and rubbed her bony back and tiny shoulders and the
         nape of her neck and finally her cheeks and her forehead and the skin
         behind her ears.
      </p>
      <p>
         She leaned backward into him, resting her head on his collarbone,
         shutting her eyes as if falling into a nap. He traced gently around
         the lids. He did the same with her drooped lips, and the scabbed
         patches on her head, until the plum-colored hair emerged from the
         roots and the face that he had seen at first was before him again.
      </p>
      <p>
         When she opened her eyes, their whites flashed out like beacons.
         &quot;I am five,&quot; she whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie lowered the stone and shuddered in short, gasp&shy;ing breaths.
         &quot;Five . . . uh-huh . . . Five years old? . . .&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She shook her head no. She held up five fingers. Then she pushed them
         against Eddie&#39;s chest, as if to say <em>your</em> five. <em>Your
         fifth person</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
         A warm breeze blew. A tear rolled down Eddie&#39;s face. Tala studied
         it the way a child studies a bug in the grass. Then she spoke to the
         space between them.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Why sad?&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Why am I sad?&quot; he whispered. &quot;Here?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She pointed down. &quot;There.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie sobbed, a final vacant sob, as if his chest were empty. He had
         surrendered all barriers; there was no grown&shy;up-to-child talk
         anymore. He said what he always said, to Marguerite, to Ruby, to the
         Captain, to the Blue Man, and, more than anyone, to himself.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;I was sad because I didn&#39;t do anything with my life. I was
         nothing. I accomplished nothing. I was lost. I felt like I wasn&#39;t
         supposed to be there.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Tala plucked the pipe-cleaner dog from the water.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Supposed to be there,&quot; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Where? At Ruby Pier?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She nodded.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Fixing rides? That was my existence?&quot; He blew a deep
         breath. &quot;Why?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She tilted her head, as if it were obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Children,&quot; she said. &quot;You keep them safe. You make
         good for me.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         She wiggled the dog against his shirt.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Is where you were supposed to be,&quot; she said, and then she
         touched his shirt patch with a small laugh and added two words,
         &quot;Eddie Main-ten-ance.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         EDDIE SLUMPED IN the rushing water. The stones of his stories were all
         around him now, beneath the surface, one touching another. He could
         feel his form melting, dissolving, and he sensed that he did not have
         long, that whatever came after the five people you meet in heaven, it
         was upon him now.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Tala?&quot; he whispered.
      </p>
      <p>
         She looked up.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;The little girl at the pier? Do you know about her?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Tala stared at her fingertips. She nodded yes.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Did I save her? Did I pull her out of the way?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Tala shook her head. &quot;No pull.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie shivered. His head dropped. So there it was. The end of his
         story.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Push,&quot; Tala said.
      </p>
      <p>
         He looked up. &quot;Push?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Push her legs. No pull. You push. Big thing fall. You keep her
         safe.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie shut his eyes in denial. &quot;But I felt her hands,&quot; he
         said. &quot;It&#39;s the only thing I remember. I <em>couldn&#39;t
         <span style="font-style: normal">have</span></em> pushed her. I felt
         her <i>h</i><em>ands.&quot;</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         Tala smiled and scooped up river water, then placed her small wet
         fingers in Eddie&#39;s adult grip. He knew right away they had been
         there before.
      </p>
      <p>
         &quot;Not <em>her</em> hands,&quot; she said. &quot;<em>My</em> hands.
         I bring you to heaven. Keep you safe.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
         <br>
         <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         WITH THAT, THE river rose quickly, engulfing Eddie&#39;s waist and
         chest and shoulders. Before he could take another breath, the noise of
         the children disappeared above him, and he was submerged in a strong
         but silent current. His grip was still entwined with Tala&#39;s, but
         he felt his body being washed from his soul, meat from the bone, and
         with it went all the pain and weariness he ever held inside him, every
         scar, every wound, every bad memory.
      </p>
      <p>
         He was nothing now, a leaf in the water, and she pulled him gently,
         through shadow and light, through shades of blue and ivory and lemon
         and black, and he realized all these colors, all along, were the
         emotions of his life. She drew him up through the breaking waves of a
         great gray ocean and he emerged in brilliant light above an almost
         unimaginable scene:
      </p>
      <p>
         There was a pier filled with thousands of people, men and women,
         fathers and mothers and children&mdash;so many children&mdash;children
         from the past and the present, children who had not yet been born,
         side by side, hand in hand, in caps, in short pants, filling the
         boardwalk and the rides and the wooden platforms, sitting on each
         other&#39;s shoulders, sitting in each other&#39;s laps. They were
         there, or would be there, because of the simple, mundane things Eddie
         had done in his life, the accidents he had prevented, the rides he had
         kept safe, the unnoticed turns he had affected every day. And while
         their lips did not move, Eddie heard their voices, more voices than he
         could have imagined, and a peace came upon him that he had never known
         before. He was free of Tala&#39;s grasp now, and he floated up above
         the sand and above the boardwalk, above the tent tops and spires of
         the midway toward the peak of the big, white Ferris wheel, where a
         cart, gently swaying, held a woman in a yel&shy;low dress&mdash; his
         wife, Marguerite, waiting with her arms ex&shy;tended. He reached for
         her and he saw her smile and the voices melded into a single word from
         God:
      </p>

      <h3>
         Epilogue
      </h3>
      <p>
         THE PARK AT RUBY PIER REOPENED THREE days after the accident. The
         story of Eddie&#39;s death was in the newspapers for a week, and then
         other stories about other deaths took its place.
      </p>
      <p>
         The ride called Freddy&#39;s Free Fall was closed for the season, but
         the next year it reopened with a new name, Daredevil Drop. Teenagers
         saw it as a badge of courage, and it drew many customers, and the
         owners were pleased.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eddie&#39;s apartment, the one he had grown up in, was rented to
         someone new, who put leaded glass in the kitchen window, obscuring the
         view of the old carousel. Dominguez, who had agreed to take over
         Eddie&#39;s job, put Eddie&#39;s few possessions in a trunk at the
         maintenance shop, alongside memorabilia from Ruby Pier, Including
         photos of the original entrance.
      </p>
      <p>
         Nicky, the young man whose key had cut the cable, made a new key when
         he got home, then sold his car four months later. He returned often to
         Ruby Pier, where he bragged to his friends that his great-grandmother
         was the woman for whom it was named.
      </p>
      <p>
         Seasons came and seasons went. And when school let out and the days
         grew long, the crowds returned to the amusement park by the great gray
         ocean&mdash;not as large as those at the theme parks, but large
         enough. Come summer, the spirit turns, and the seashore beckons with a
         song of the waves, and people gather for carousels and Ferris wheels
         and sweet iced drinks and cotton candy.
      </p>
      <p>
         Lines formed at Ruby Pier&mdash;just as a line formed someplace else:
         five people waiting, in five chosen memories, for a little girl named
         Amy or Annie to grow and to love and to age and to die, and to finally
         have her question answered&mdash;why she lived and what she lived for.
         And in that line now was a whiskered old man, with a linen cap and a
         crooked nose, who waited in a place called the Stardust Band Shell to
         share his part of the secret of heaven: that each affects the other
         and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but
         the stories are all one.
